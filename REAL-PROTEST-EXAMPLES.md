#### Pages 2+: Comp Equity Grid
A table/matrix comparing:

| Field | Subject | Comp 1 | Comp 2 | Comp 3 | Comp 4 | Comp 5 |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Address | Your home | 123 Oak | 456 Pine | ... | ... | ... |
| Year Built | 2005 | 2003 | 2007 | ... | ... | ... |
| Living Area (sqft) | 2,000 | 1,900 | 2,100 | ... | ... | ... |
| Bed/Bath | 4/2.5 | 4/2.5 | 4/3 | ... | ... | ... |
| Quality | Avg | Avg | Avg | ... | ... | ... |
| Appraised Value | $350,000 | $320,000 | $330,000 | ... | ... | ... |
| $/sqft | $175 | $168 | $157 | ... | ... | ... |
| **Adjustments** | — | +$X | -$Y | ... | ... | ... |
| **Adjusted Value** | — | $325,000 | $325,000 | ... | ... | ... |

**Median of adjusted values = Proposed fair value**

### Key SquareDeal Methodology Points:
- 5-10 comps recommended (quality > quantity)

- Year built within ±10 years
- Size within 10-20% of subject
- Same number of stories (1-story vs 2-story matters)
- Similar bed/bath count
- For sales comps: use prior year sales (e.g., 2024 sales for 2025 protest)
- **80% of homeowners using their comps got a reduction in 2024**

### SquareDeal's Free CAD Evidence Review
- Upload CAD evidence PDF → system automatically finds errors, favorable comps, stale values, inconsistencies
- **This is exactly what Overtaxed could do**

---

## 3. CAD Evidence Packet — What the District Provides

### What's Inside (per SquareDeal.tax and O'Connor):

1. **Property Record Card (PRC)**
   - Living area and land size
   - Year built, quality rating, condition
   - Features (garage, pool, porch, etc.)
   - CAD's depreciation / "effective age"
   - Number of beds/baths
   - **Common errors:** Wrong sqft, incorrect features, wrong bed/bath count

2. **Sales Comparables Grid**
   - Table of recent property sales CAD claims support their value
   - Each row: address, sale date, living area, lot size, sale price, $/sqft
   - Adjustments for size, condition, features
   - **Tactic:** CAD often cherry-picks higher-value sales or comps from different locations

3. **Equity Comparables Grid**
   - Similar properties and their appraised values per sqft
   - Used for "equal and uniform" argument
   - **Tactic:** They often skip lower-valued homes that would help your case

4. **Adjustment Tables**
   - Internal formulas: e.g., $40/sqft for extra living area, $10,000 for a pool
   - Can be inconsistent or unrealistic

5. **Photos** — Street-view or aerial (often outdated or misleading)

6. **Maps** — Location of your property and comps

7. **Other** — MLS listings, building permits, market trend reports

### The "Stale Comps" Problem (Critical Intelligence):
- CAD builds comp grids using **preliminary values** from April/May
- As protest season progresses, many comps get **reduced after their own protests**
- **CAD doesn't update your evidence packet** with these reductions
- **Counter-strategy:** Look up each CAD comp in public records BEFORE your hearing — bring their current (post-protest) values as evidence

### How to Get CAD Evidence:
- Texas Property Tax Code §41.461 — CAD MUST provide evidence 14 days before hearing
- Some CADs auto-post to online portal; others only send on request
- **Always request in writing** — creates paper trail
- If CAD fails to deliver, you can ask ARB to **exclude their evidence entirely**
- Cost: Free (CAD cannot charge for copies)

---

## 4. Winning Evidence Packet Structure — The Gold Standard

### Based on all sources, the ideal evidence packet contains:

#### Cover Page (1 page)
- Your name, property address, account/parcel number
- Current assessed/appraised value
- **Your proposed value** (specific number)
- Brief statement: "I request a value of $X based on comparable sales, equity analysis, and property condition"
- Table of contents listing all evidence sections

#### Section 1: Sales Comparable Analysis (2-3 pages)
- **Table format** with columns:
  - Address | Sale Date | Sale Price | Sqft | $/Sqft | Year Built | Beds/Baths | Adjustments | Adjusted Value
- 3-5 comps, ideally:
  - Within 6-12 months of valuation date (Jan 1)
  - Within 0.5 mile (up to 1 mile if needed)
  - Similar size (within 10-20%), age (within 5-10 years), features
- Mathematical adjustments for each difference
- **Median of adjusted values = your proposed market value**
- Map showing comp locations relative to your property

#### Section 2: Equity/Unequal Appraisal Analysis (2-3 pages)
- **Comp Equity Grid** with columns:
  - Address | Year Built | Sqft | Appraised Value | $/Sqft | Quality | Condition | Adjustments | Adjusted Value
- 5-10 similar properties with LOWER appraised values
- Calculate median $/sqft → multiply by your sqft = proposed value
- This is the "equal and uniform" argument
- Can use even when market value seems fair

#### Section 3: Property Condition Documentation (1-3 pages)
- Photos of:
  - Roof damage, foundation cracks, water stains
  - Outdated kitchens/bathrooms vs. CAD's updated comps
  - Deferred maintenance (chipping paint, worn flooring)
  - External obsolescence (traffic, neighboring blight)
- Timestamped and labeled (e.g., "Kitchen, outdated cabinets, Jan 2026")
- Repair estimates from licensed contractors on letterhead
- Focus on costly, buyer-noticeable issues (roof, HVAC, foundation)

#### Section 4: CAD Record Errors (1 page)
- Highlighted printout of CAD's property record
- Circle/underline incorrect details
- Provide corrections with supporting documents (survey, blueprints, deed)
- Common errors: wrong sqft, extra bedrooms, incorrect features

#### Section 5: Supporting Documents
- Recent appraisal report (optional, $300-600)
- Closing disclosure (if purchased within 1-2 years)
- Market trend data (neighborhood price declines)
- Photos of CAD's comps from HAR/MLS showing their superior condition

### Formatting Tips:
- **Number all pages** for quick reference during hearing
- Bring **4-5 copies** (3 ARB members + 1 appraiser + 1 for you)
- Group by topic: comps → condition → errors → supporting docs
- Use simple tables and maps — avoid cluttered visuals
- **Keep presentation to 5-7 minutes** (hearings are 15 min total)
- Start with your **strongest evidence first** (usually comps)

## 5. Real Homeowner Success Stories from Reddit

### Story 1: Austin — $30K Reduction with Zillow Data Only
- **Source:** r/Austin, May 2025
- **Evidence used:** "My evidence was purely based on Zillow's Travis county YOY price decline of 5%. I took last year's appraisal value, subtracted 5%, that was my proposed estimate. Gave nothing about house condition or comps etc."
- **Result:** $30,000 reduction compromise
- **Lesson:** Even minimal evidence can work if the market data supports it

### Story 2: r/homeowners — Random Sale Prices from Zillow/Redfin
- **Source:** r/homeowners, April 2023
- **Evidence used:** "I submitted a protest online based on some random recent sale prices in the area from Zillow and Redfin"
- **Result:** "Had an offer for reduced taxes in about an hour with no need to go to tax authority"
- **Lesson:** Online/automated protests with even basic comps can yield fast offers

### Story 3: Austin — 19.7% Self-Protest Reduction
- **Source:** r/Austin, August 2025
- **Evidence used:** Self-protest with comps from realtor including photos of general condition
- **Result:** 19.7% reduction
- **Lesson:** Realtor-sourced comps with condition photos are powerful

### Story 4: Fort Worth — Photos of Broken/Outdated Items
- **Source:** r/FortWorth, April 2023
- **Evidence used:** "Went around and took pictures of random things that were broken or outdated, and submitted them with my protest"
- **Result:** Auto-offer at submission (declined), then better offer by mail (accepted). No appearance required.
- **Lesson:** Condition photos alone can trigger offers before hearing

### Story 5: Houston — Using CAD's Own Evidence Against Them
- **Source:** r/houston, April 2025
- **Evidence used:** Downloaded HCAD evidence file, looked up photos on HAR of the recently sold houses HCAD was using as comps. Screen-capped flashy updated kitchens/bathrooms from those listings, then took unflattering photos of own kitchen/baths to show lower CDU (condition/desirability/utility)
- **Result:** Reduction granted
- **Lesson:** **Comparing photos of CAD's comps vs. your property is devastatingly effective**

### Story 6: Austin — Using CAD's Own Evidence Packet
- **Source:** r/Austin, October 2019
- **Evidence used:** "I used the appraisal district's comps that they provided in their evidence packet" — turned their own data against them
- **Result:** Successful protest without MLS access or third-party help
- **Lesson:** The CAD's own evidence often contains data that supports a lower value

### Story 7: Multi-Year Strategy
- **Source:** r/texas, April 2025
- **Evidence used:** "I filed the protest every year just to keep my estimated market value as low as possible. I also want to get the evidence packet from the assessor's office every year. Usually, they've done a poor enough job that their own packet doesn't support their assessed value. And by collecting them over the years I have multiple comps to use."
- **Result:** Consistent reductions year over year
- **Lesson:** Annual protesting + collecting CAD evidence builds a comp library over time

### Story 8: Austin — Settlement Before Hearing
- **Source:** r/Austin, April 2021
- **Evidence used:** Filed protest and requested CAD evidence
- **Result:** "When they sent the evidence packet they also sent over their settlement offer which was actually lower than my original opinion of value, so I accepted it"
- **Lesson:** Sometimes just filing + requesting evidence triggers a favorable auto-settlement

## 6. Comp Adjustment Methodology — Standard TX Amounts

### Standard Adjustment Values (from Texas Tax Protest, O'Connor, industry):

| Feature | Typical Adjustment | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| **Square footage** | $100-$150/sqft | Use local $/sqft from recent sales. E.g., 200 sqft difference × $100/sqft = $20,000 |
| **Pool** | -$20,000 to -$30,000 | Depends on type, age, condition. Subtract if comp has pool and yours doesn't |
| **New roof** | -$8,000 to -$15,000 | Depends on material and size |
| **Extra bedroom** | -$5,000 to -$10,000 | Per room |
| **Extra bathroom** | -$5,000 to -$10,000 | Half bath worth less than full |
| **Garage (extra bay)** | -$5,000 to -$15,000 | Depends on area |
| **Age/year built** | Varies | 5-10 year range acceptable; older = lower adjustment |
| **Renovated kitchen** | -$15,000 to -$40,000 | Major renovation vs. original |
| **Condition (CDU)** | % adjustment | "Excellent" vs "Average" can be 10-20% |
| **Lot size** | Context-dependent | Usually minor unless dramatically different |

### How to Calculate (Step by Step):
1. Find comp's sale price: $400,000
2. Comp has pool (+$25,000), extra 200 sqft (+$20,000), newer roof (+$10,000)
3. Total adjustments: -$55,000
4. Adjusted comp value: $345,000
5. Your home should be valued at or below $345,000

### The Equity (Unequal Appraisal) Method:
1. Find 5-10 similar properties in your neighborhood
2. Get their appraised values and sqft from CAD database
3. Calculate each property's $/sqft
4. Calculate **median** $/sqft (not average — median is more robust)
5. Multiply median $/sqft × your property's sqft = fair appraised value
6. If your current appraisal exceeds this by >10%, you qualify for relief under TX Tax Code §42.26

## 7. Cook County (Illinois) Appeals

### Cook County Board of Review Process:

**Filing:** Official Board of Review Complaint Form (downloadable PDF)
- **URL:** https://www.cookcountyboardofreview.com/residential-appeals
- Download: https://www.cookcountyboardofreview.com/sites/g/files/ywwepo261/files/document/file/2025-06/2025%20Complaint%20form%20(1)_0.pdf

**Grounds for Appeal (5 types):**

1. **Uniformity (Lack of)** — Most common
   - Your property assessed higher $/sqft than similar properties
   - Compare to same neighborhood, same classification code
   - Formula: Building Assessment ÷ Building Square Footage = Building Assessment per sqft
   - Compare your $/sqft to comparable properties' $/sqft
   - Data source: CookCountyAssessor.com

2. **Recent Purchase**
   - Bought in past 3 years at arm's length for less than current Market Value
   - Submit closing documents as evidence

3. **Market**
   - Market value per assessor higher than recently sold similar homes (within 3 years)
   - Use realtor data or local township assessor data

4. **Correction of Factual Error**
   - Incorrect sqft, wrong property description
   - Submit: appraisal, plat of survey, architect's letter/drawing

5. **Special Circumstances**
   - Fire, flood, demolition, uninhabitable property

### Key Differences from Texas:
- **Two-appeal rule:** Can appeal at both Assessor AND Board of Review
- Corporations/LLCs MUST be represented by an attorney
- Consultants CANNOT represent homeowners at BOR (only attorneys)
- Individual taxpayers CAN represent themselves
- BOR hosts regular outreach events explaining evidence

### Kensington Research (IL Market Leader):
- 90%+ success rate at both levels
- Proprietary algorithm analyzing thousands of individual results
- 35,000+ successful appeals
- Free initial assessment
- **Key insight:** Their algorithm is continuously adjusted based on appeal outcomes

## 9. What ARB Members Prefer Seeing

### Based on professional guidance across all sources:

**DO:**
- ✅ Start with a **one-page summary** of your proposed value and why
- ✅ Use **tables and grids** (comp tables, equity grids) — easy to scan
- ✅ Include a **map** showing comp locations relative to your property
- ✅ Keep presentation to **5-7 minutes** (total hearing is ~15 min)
- ✅ Be **data-driven** — numbers, calculations, documented facts
- ✅ Bring **clear, labeled photos** (timestamped preferred)
- ✅ Use **simple visuals** — highlighted, not cluttered
- ✅ Number all pages for quick reference
- ✅ Be polite, professional, concise
- ✅ State your proposed value upfront
- ✅ Present strongest evidence first (usually comps)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Complain about tax rates or tax bills (ARB only sets VALUE)
- ❌ Make emotional arguments or personal financial pleas
- ❌ Present 10+ comps (3-5 strong ones beat quantity)
- ❌ Use unverified data (Zillow alone is weak; cross-check with official records)
- ❌ Argue with ARB members or appraiser
- ❌ Present new evidence after closing statement
- ❌ Skip the informal hearing — many reductions happen there

### Hearing Flow (TAMU Research Center):
1. Opening questions (basis: market value, equity, or both)
2. Homeowner presents evidence (5 min)
3. CAD appraiser responds (5 min)
4. Rebuttal/follow-up (1-2 rounds)
5. Board deliberation
6. Decision announced orally

## 10. Countering CAD Evidence — Professional Tactics

### Tactic 1: Expose Stale Comps
- Look up each CAD comp in public records
- Check if their values were **reduced after protest**
- Bring printouts of current (post-protest) values
- "CAD's comp at 123 Oak was valued at $225/sqft in their packet, but it was reduced to $200/sqft after protest"

### Tactic 2: Challenge Sale Ratios
- **Sale ratio = CAD appraised value ÷ actual sale price**
- If ratios are inconsistent, CAD's analysis is unreliable
- Example: Comp A at 1.02, Comp B at 0.92 = inconsistent methodology

### Tactic 3: Challenge Comp Selection
- Are comps in the same neighborhood code?
- Same number of stories?
- Similar bed/bath counts?
- Similar year built?
- Are any from different zip codes? (This has happened!)
- "These comps are in the same neighborhood code or market area as my property" — cites TX Tax Code §42.26(a)(3)

### Tactic 4: Challenge CDU/Quality Ratings
- CAD may assign "Excellent" desirability even without recent remodeling
- Example from SquareDeal: Home renovated in 2000, but by 2022 (22 years later), CAD still rated it "Very Good" without adjustment
- Request correction of outdated desirability ratings

### Tactic 5: Use CAD's Own Comps Against Them
- Their packet may include comps that actually support YOUR lower value
- If their lowest comp is below their proposed value, use it

### Tactic 6: Photo Comparison
- From r/houston: Screenshot glamorous HAR listing photos of CAD's comps (updated kitchens, modern bathrooms)
- Place next to unflattering photos of your own kitchen/bathrooms
- Visual proof that your property has lower CDU than their comps

---

## 11. Key Takeaways for Overtaxed

### What Our Evidence Packet Should Include:
1. **One-page summary** with proposed value and clear rationale
2. **Sales comp table** with mathematical adjustments (3-5 comps)
3. **Equity comp grid** with $/sqft analysis (5-10 comps)
4. **Neighborhood map** plotting all comps
5. **Property condition photos** with captions
6. **Repair estimates** if applicable
7. **CAD record error corrections** if any found
8. **CAD evidence rebuttal** (challenging their specific comps)

### What Makes Us Different from Existing Services:
- **SquareDeal charges ~$50-90** for comps report; firms charge 25-50% of savings
- **Chandler Crouch is free** but only Tarrant County
- **Nobody automates the CAD evidence review + counter-evidence generation**
- **Nobody shows side-by-side photo comparisons** automatically
- **The "stale comps" check is manual everywhere** — we could automate it
- **Equity + market value dual analysis** is what pros do but DIYers miss

### Format Preferences by Platform:
- **Texas:** Print 4-5 copies of packet OR provide thumb drive for digital display
- **HCAD (Harris):** Electronic submission via owners.hcad.org at least 3 days before hearing; ARB requires 4 printed copies
- **Cook County IL:** Official BOR Complaint Form + supporting evidence

### The Comp That Wins:
- Recent (6-12 months)
- Close (< 0.5 mile ideal, < 1 mile acceptable)
- Similar (10-20% size range, 5-10 year age range)
- Same features (stories, bed/bath, pool/no pool)
- Properly adjusted (dollar amounts for each difference)
- From reliable source (MLS > county records > Zillow)

### The Number That Matters:
**Median adjusted value of your comps = Your proposed value**

Not average. Median. It's more robust against outliers, and it's what the Texas Property Tax Code specifically references (§42.26).
