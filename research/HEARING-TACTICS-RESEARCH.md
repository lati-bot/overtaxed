## 1. The 5-Minute ARB Hearing Script

### The Setup: What You Walk Into

- **Who's there:** 3 ARB panel members (local citizens appointed by a judge), 1 CAD appraiser, and you
- **Total hearing time:** ~15 minutes shared. You get approximately **5 minutes** for your presentation, then the appraiser gets ~5 minutes, then brief rebuttals and deliberation
- **Format:** Both sides sworn in → you present → appraiser presents → rebuttals → deliberation → decision announced verbally on the spot

### The Script (Verbatim Template)

**[Opening — 30 seconds]**

> "Thank you, members of the Board. My name is [NAME], and I'm the owner of [ADDRESS], account number [ACCOUNT #]. I'm protesting both the market value and the unequal appraisal of my property. The district has appraised my home at $[NOTICED VALUE]. Based on my evidence, I'm requesting a value of $[YOUR OPINION OF VALUE]. I've provided copies of my evidence for each of you."

*Hand evidence packets to each of the 3 ARB members if in-person. If virtual, confirm they have the uploaded documents.*

**[Errors in Property Record — 30 seconds, if applicable]**

> "First, I'd like to point out [NUMBER] errors in the district's property record. The district lists my home as [WRONG DETAIL — e.g., 2,600 sq ft], but it's actually [CORRECT DETAIL — e.g., 2,400 sq ft] as shown in [SOURCE — survey/blueprints/deed]. This alone accounts for approximately $[DOLLAR AMOUNT] in overvaluation."

**[Comparable Sales Evidence — 90 seconds]**

> "Turning to page [X] of my evidence packet, I've identified [3-5] comparable sales within [distance] of my property, all sold within the last 12 months. As you can see in my comparison table:
> - [COMP 1 ADDRESS] — sold for $[PRICE] on [DATE], [SQ FT], built [YEAR]
> - [COMP 2 ADDRESS] — sold for $[PRICE] on [DATE], [SQ FT], built [YEAR]  
> - [COMP 3 ADDRESS] — sold for $[PRICE] on [DATE], [SQ FT], built [YEAR]
>
> After adjustments for [size/features/condition], the average adjusted sale price is $[AVERAGE], which supports my requested value of $[YOUR VALUE]."

**[Equity / Unequal Appraisal — 60 seconds]**

> "On page [X], I've prepared an equity comparison showing how my property is appraised relative to similar properties in my neighborhood. Under Texas Tax Code Section 42.26(a)(3), my property should be appraised uniformly with comparable properties. Here are [5-10] properties with the same neighborhood code as mine — same construction quality, similar size and age — yet they're appraised at a median of $[MEDIAN VALUE] per square foot, compared to my $[YOUR $/SF]. My appraised value should not exceed the median of these comparable properties."

**[Property Condition Issues — 60 seconds, if applicable]**

> "Additionally, my property has condition issues that reduce its market value. As shown in the photos on page [X]:
> - [ISSUE 1 — e.g., 'The roof is 22 years old and needs replacement']
> - [ISSUE 2 — e.g., 'There is visible foundation settling with interior wall cracks']
> - [ISSUE 3 — e.g., 'The HVAC system is original from 2003 and requires replacement']
>
> I've obtained contractor estimates totaling $[TOTAL] for these necessary repairs. These are documented on page [X]."

**[Closing — 30 seconds]**

> "In summary, the comparable sales, the equity analysis, and the condition of my property all support a value of $[YOUR VALUE] rather than the district's appraised value of $[NOTICED VALUE]. I respectfully request the Board set the value at $[YOUR VALUE]. Thank you."

### Timing Breakdown

| Section | Time |
|---------|------|
| Opening & requested value | 30 sec |
| Record errors | 30 sec |
| Comparable sales | 90 sec |
| Equity/unequal appraisal | 60 sec |
| Condition issues | 60 sec |
| Closing | 30 sec |
| **Total** | **~5 minutes** |

### Critical Script Rules

1. **State your requested value FIRST** — don't bury the lede
2. **Lead with your strongest evidence** — comps if you have great comps, equity if your equity grid is stronger
3. **Reference page numbers** — "As shown on page 3 of my evidence..." keeps it organized
4. **Never introduce new evidence in rebuttal** — only counter what the appraiser said
5. **End with a clear ask** — restate the specific dollar value you want

---

## 2. Appraiser Rebuttals & Exact Counter-Arguments

### Rebuttal #1: "We used different comps"

**What they mean:** The CAD has its own comp set that supports a higher value.

**Your counter:**
> "I've reviewed the district's evidence packet provided under Section 41.461. I'd like to point out that [specific problems with their comps — e.g., 'Comp #2 in your grid is 1,500 square feet larger than my home' or 'Comp #3 is in a different neighborhood code' or 'Comp #1 recently received a value reduction from $X to $Y, which actually supports my position']."

**Key move:** Before the hearing, get the CAD's evidence packet (required 14 days before hearing under Texas Tax Code §41.461). Cross-reference their comps on the CAD website. If any of their comps have received protest reductions, point this out — it undermines their own median.

**Pro tip from SquareDeal.tax:** *"If any of the CAD's selected comps have recently received value reductions, bring this up during the hearing. Highlighting reduced comps in their own evidence can undermine their median and strengthen your position."*

### Rebuttal #2: "Your comps are too far away"

**What they mean:** Your comparable properties aren't in the same market area.

**Your counter:**
> "My comps are all within [X] miles and share the same neighborhood code [CODE]. Under Texas Tax Code Section 42.26(a)(3), comparable properties in the same neighborhood are valid for equity comparison. Can you explain specifically why you believe these comps are invalid — is it location, age, size, or another factor?"

**Standards to cite:**
- Same neighborhood/market area code ✓
- Within 1 mile is ideal; up to 2 miles is generally acceptable
- Same school district
- Similar lot size, year built, quality rating
- Same number of stories

**Force specificity:** Say: *"Can you explain why you believe these comps are invalid?"* — Many times they won't have a specific reason. Forcing them to articulate why puts them on the defensive.

### Rebuttal #3: "Market conditions support our value"

**What they mean:** The overall market is up, so your property should be worth more.

**Your counter:**
> "I'm not arguing about market direction — I'm arguing about the specific value of MY property. The comparable sales I've presented are from the same market conditions and the same time period. These actual transactions in my neighborhood show the market supports a value of $[YOUR VALUE], not $[THEIR VALUE]."

**Stronger version if market is declining:**
> "In fact, market conditions in my area show softening. I have [X] homes that were listed for [PRICE] and sat on market for [MONTHS], with price reductions from $[ORIGINAL] to $[REDUCED]. This demonstrates the market is not supporting values at the district's level."

**Texas A&M TRERC tip:** *"Look online at list prices and time on the market. While list prices are not applicable as comps in an appraisal, they may help you set an upper limit on your opinion of value. Properties listed for extended periods with successive price reductions indicate market weakness."*

### Rebuttal #4: "Your property has X feature that comps don't"

**What they mean:** Your home is worth more because of a pool, extra garage, larger lot, etc.

**Your counter:**
> "I've already made adjustments for those differences in my comparison table. As shown on page [X], I've adjusted Comp #[N] by $[AMOUNT] for [FEATURE]. Even after adjustments, the comps support my requested value."

**If they claim features you DON'T have or have gotten wrong:**
> "Actually, the district's record shows [FEATURE] but my property does not have that / that feature is in [CONDITION]. I have documentation showing [EVIDENCE]."

**Standard adjustment amounts (residential, Texas metro areas):**
- Pool: $10,000-$25,000 (depends on area)
- Extra bedroom: $5,000-$15,000
- Extra bathroom: $3,000-$10,000
- Garage (per bay): $5,000-$10,000
- Per square foot of living area: varies by neighborhood ($100-$200+ is common)
- Age difference: $500-$2,000 per year of effective age difference

### Rebuttal #5: "These are not sales comps — we need sale prices"

**What they mean:** They're trying to dismiss your equity/unequal appraisal evidence because it shows appraised values, not sale prices.

**Your counter (direct legal citation):**
> "I filed my protest on grounds of unequal appraisal. Texas Property Tax Code Section 42.26(a)(3) explicitly provides for equity protests using APPRAISED values of comparable properties — not sales prices. My evidence compares appraised values, which is exactly what the law requires for an unequal appraisal claim."

**This is one of the most common bad-faith dismissals by CAD appraisers and even some ARB panels.** Texas is a non-disclosure state — sale prices aren't public. The equity argument exists specifically because of this.

### Rebuttal #6: "The condition issues you show aren't significant"

**Your counter:**
> "A buyer considering my property would factor in these costs before making an offer. The contractor estimates I've provided — from licensed contractors, on official letterhead — total $[AMOUNT]. Whether you consider the repairs significant or not, a rational buyer would subtract these costs from their offer price."

**Show photos of the worst stuff:** Foundation cracks, water damage, mold, bare studs from demolition, roof damage, outdated kitchens/baths. Per a Reddit user: *"When the hearing panel saw photos of bare studded bathrooms with nought but a hole in the ground, they were moved to adjust the value for me."*

## 3. iSettle (Harris County) Strategy

### How iSettle Works

1. **File protest online via iFile** at owners.hcad.org using your iFile PIN from your notice
2. **Upload evidence** (equity comps, sales comps, photos, repair estimates) and enter your **Opinion of Value**
3. **HCAD reviews** your evidence and sends a **settlement offer** via email
4. **You have ~10 days** to log in and accept or reject the offer
5. **If you accept** → protest ends, new value is final
6. **If you reject or ignore** → case goes to formal ARB hearing
7. **No informal in-person meeting** with iFile — iSettle IS the informal step

### Strategy for Getting the Best iSettle Offer

**Set your Opinion of Value strategically:**
- If you file a "realistic opinion of value," you're more likely to get an iSettle offer
- HCAD reviews "trends in reductions in surrounding properties" — if your suggested value falls within those parameters, they'll make an offer
- **Don't go crazy low** — an absurdly low opinion of value may not trigger an offer at all
- **Aim 10-15% below** the noticed value as your opening position

**Upload strong evidence with your iFile:**
- Equity comps showing lower $/sqft for similar homes in your neighborhood code
- Photos of condition issues
- Contractor repair estimates
- If recently purchased, your closing disclosure showing the actual purchase price
- Check both boxes: "Value is over market value" AND "Value is unequal compared with other properties"

### When to Accept vs. Reject iSettle

**ACCEPT the iSettle offer when:**
- The reduction is **5% or more** of the noticed value (per SquareDeal.tax recommendation)
- Your evidence is moderate — you don't have a slam-dunk case
- You don't want to deal with the time/stress of an ARB hearing
- The offer is within ~$5,000-$10,000 of your opinion of value

**REJECT the iSettle offer when:**
- You have **overwhelming evidence** (recent purchase price significantly lower, major condition issues with contractor estimates, clearly superior comps)
- The offer barely moves the needle (< 3% reduction)
- You have a closing disclosure showing you paid significantly less than the noticed value
- You're willing to file for binding arbitration if the ARB doesn't go your way

### Critical iSettle Warnings

⚠️ **The iSettle offer is TIME-SENSITIVE.** If you don't respond within the window (~10 days), it expires and you go straight to ARB. Do NOT ignore it.

⚠️ **Rejecting iSettle = no informal meeting.** With online protests, iSettle IS your informal. You go straight to formal ARB.

⚠️ **The ARB is not bound by the iSettle offer.** They can (and do) set values HIGHER than what iSettle offered. One Reddit user: *"Final value $100k above iSettle offer, and $117k more than I bought the house for 1 year ago."*

⚠️ **DIY homeowners actually show better success rates** than agents for residential properties in Harris County, per SquareDeal.tax data analysis.

### The "Golden Opportunity" Before ARB

Even if you rejected iSettle, you typically meet with a county appraiser **right before your ARB hearing**. This is another chance to negotiate:

> *"Appraisers often prefer to settle cases outside the ARB room — it saves everyone time. If you're prepared with evidence, you might still walk away with a reduction without ever setting foot in the hearing."* — SquareDeal.tax

## 4. Informal vs. Formal Hearing: When to Accept, When to Fight

### Informal Hearing (Settlement Phase)

**What it is:** A direct negotiation with a CAD appraiser — either in-person walk-in, phone call, or online (iSettle-style). Less formal, more conversational.

**Key characteristics:**
- Typically happens June-July after protest filing
- CAD appraiser has authority to offer reductions
- Not all counties offer informal — some go straight to ARB
- **If you accept a settlement at informal, you CANNOT proceed to ARB, binding arbitration, or judicial appeal** (per O'Connor Tax)

**When to ACCEPT the informal offer:**
- ✅ The reduction meets or exceeds 5% of noticed value
- ✅ Your evidence is "good but not great"
- ✅ The ARB in your county has a history of siding with the district
- ✅ You want certainty and don't want to risk an unfavorable ARB panel
- ✅ The time/hassle of a formal hearing isn't worth the potential additional reduction

**When to REJECT and go to ARB:**
- ❌ The offer is less than 3% — barely worth your time
- ❌ You have strong evidence (recent purchase below appraised, contractor estimates, error corrections)
- ❌ You believe the correct value is significantly lower than what informal offered
- ❌ You're willing to go to binding arbitration if ARB doesn't work

### Formal ARB Hearing

**What it is:** Structured hearing before a 3-person independent citizen panel. Both sides present evidence and the ARB makes a binding determination.

**Key characteristics:**
- Usually July-August
- ~15 minutes total (5 min each side + rebuttals + deliberation)
- ARB announces decision verbally at end of hearing
- Written order follows by certified mail
- **ARB cannot raise your value** — can only lower it or leave it unchanged
- You can appeal the ARB decision to binding arbitration or district court

**Critical insight from O'Connor Tax:**
> *"The ARB is supposed to have the burden of proof — the CAD must prove your property is worth what they claim. Many ARBs don't enforce this properly, but legally, if your evidence has an edge on theirs, the ARB must side with you."*

### The Decision Matrix

| Factor | Accept Informal | Go to ARB |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Offer vs. your target | Within $5K | $10K+ gap |
| Evidence strength | Moderate | Strong |
| County ARB reputation | Unfavorable | Fair/favorable |
| Your time/stress tolerance | Low | Willing |
| Plan to arbitrate if needed | No | Yes |
| Recently purchased below appraisal | N/A | Definitely go |
| Major condition issues with estimates | N/A | Definitely go |

### Pro Tips for Informal

- **Ask the appraiser what evidence they find most compelling** — use their feedback to strengthen your ARB case if they won't settle
- **Take notes on everything the appraiser says** — their reasoning, their comps, their objections. This intel is gold for ARB.
- **Don't reveal your strongest evidence first** — if you think you'll need to go to ARB, you can hold back some evidence for the formal hearing

## 5. Presentation Order, Timing & Body Language

### Optimal Presentation Order

Based on consensus from O'Connor Tax, SquareDeal, Texas PVP, and CBS News Texas:

1. **State your name, property, and requested value** (30 sec)
2. **Correct any record errors** (30 sec) — quick, factual, hard to dispute
3. **Present your strongest evidence first** (90 sec) — usually comps or equity
4. **Present supporting evidence** (60 sec) — condition issues, repair estimates
5. **Summarize and restate your ask** (30 sec)

**Why this order works:**
- ARB members hear dozens of cases per day. They're tired. The first 60 seconds is when they're most attentive
- Starting with your number and strongest evidence front-loads the impact
- Condition issues are supporting, not primary — they add emotional weight to the data
- Ending with a clean restatement of your number is what sticks in their minds during deliberation

### Timing: The 15-Minute Reality

Per CBS News Texas tax attorney Bobby Ola: *"Each side gets about five minutes to present their evidence. You just need to be short, to the point, have all your facts lined up."*

**Actual breakdown:**
- Check-in/intro/swearing in: 2-3 min
- **Your presentation: 5 min** ← this is YOUR time
- Appraiser's rebuttal: 5 min
- Your rebuttal: 1-2 min
- Deliberation: 1-2 min
- Decision: 1 min

**Practice with a timer.** If you go over 5 minutes, the chair will cut you off. If you have 6 minutes of material, you'll rush the end and it'll sound sloppy.

### Body Language & Demeanor

**DO:**
- Dress business casual (slacks and collared shirt, or equivalent)
- Address ARB members as "members of the Board" or "Chairman"
- Maintain eye contact with ALL three ARB members, not just the chair
- Speak slowly and clearly — they're processing a lot of numbers
- Nod when the appraiser makes a point you agree with
- Keep hands visible and relaxed

**DO NOT:**
- Cross your arms
- Sigh, eye-roll, or shake your head when the appraiser speaks
- Interrupt anyone — especially during deliberation
- Stand up unless invited to
- Tap, fidget, or shuffle papers nervously

**During deliberation (the hardest part):**
Per Bobby Ola: *"You can hear everything they're saying about both presentations, and you're kind of holding your tongue going, 'Oh, what could I have done better?'"*

You MUST stay silent. No interjections. No corrections. The deliberation is between the 3 ARB members only. Anything you say can only hurt you.

### Virtual Hearing Tips

- Test your camera, microphone, and internet BEFORE the hearing
- Good lighting (face a window or have a lamp in front of you)
- Clean, professional background
- Have all evidence uploaded in advance
- Have physical copies in front of you for reference
- Mute when not speaking
- If you're using a single-member panel (available in some counties), virtual can actually be MORE favorable — less intimidating, more focused

### The "Request a Single-Member Panel" Hack

Texas law allows you to request a single-member ARB panel instead of a three-member panel. Advantages:
- Less intimidating
- Faster hearing
- One person to convince instead of three
- Per Reddit user: *"If you do a virtual, request a single appraiser, not a 3 panel ARB"*

Disadvantage: Only one vote decides your case — no chance of a 2-1 split in your favor.

## 6. What Gets Protests DENIED

### Instant Credibility Killers

**1. Showing up with no evidence**
> *"A lot of people don't bring in any evidence. They'll just talk about the absurdity of everything and say it's not worth this much."* — Bobby Ola, Tax Attorney, CBS News Texas

This is the #1 reason protests fail. Saying "it's too high" without data is meaningless. The ARB legally cannot reduce your value based on your opinion alone.

**2. Complaining about tax rates or your tax bill**
The ARB has ZERO control over tax rates. They only determine appraised value. Saying "my taxes are too high" is irrelevant and wastes your precious 5 minutes.

Per Texas Comptroller: *"While the ARB can consider the effect of general economic and environmental factors on your property's value, it cannot take into account your personal economic situation."*

**3. Getting emotional or confrontational**
> *"'This is a ludicrous price — if you think it's worth this much, I'll sell it to you today.' People get emotional and it works against them."* — Bobby Ola

ARB members are volunteers. They hear dozens of cases. Being rude to them or the appraiser will make them LESS sympathetic, not more.

**4. Using weak or irrelevant comps**
- Comps older than 12 months
- Comps more than 2 miles away
- Comps from different neighborhood codes without adjustment
- Comps that are fundamentally different (condo vs. house, 1-story vs. 2-story)
- Zillow "Zestimates" (not taken seriously)

**5. Overloading with evidence**
Bringing 10+ comps, 30 pages of data, and a 20-minute presentation when you have 5 minutes. It dilutes your strongest arguments and confuses the panel.

**6. Guessing on your math**
Per Bobby Ola: *"Have a number. And you need to have a way of getting to that number that's pretty easy to understand."*

If you can't clearly explain how you arrived at your requested value, the ARB won't adopt it.

### Structural Mistakes

**7. Missing the evidence deadline**
Under Texas Tax Code §41.67, you must submit evidence to the district at least 14 days before the hearing. Showing up with new evidence the day of can get it excluded.

**8. Not requesting the CAD's evidence packet**
Under §41.461, the CAD must give you their evidence 14 days before hearing. If you don't request it, you walk in blind to their comp set and can't rebut effectively.

**9. Accepting informal settlement then trying to go to ARB**
If you sign an informal settlement, it's DONE. You cannot then go to the ARB. The settlement may even expire if not agreed to before the hearing date.

**10. Missing your hearing entirely**
If you no-show, your protest is dismissed and the noticed value stands. You have 4 days to file for a new hearing showing "good cause." The chairman decides — and they usually say no.

### What Pisses Off ARB Members Specifically

Based on Reddit, O'Connor, and consultant reports:

- **Political rants** about government, taxation philosophy, or "my rights"
- **Comparing to other states** ("In Florida, taxes are...")
- **Bringing irrelevant witnesses** or family members who also want to talk
- **Arguing with the appraiser** during their presentation — you'll get your rebuttal time
- **Refusing to answer direct questions** from the panel
- **Claiming the property is worth far less than any reasonable estimate** — asking for a $200K value on a $500K home with no support

## 7. Real Success Stories with Specific Evidence

### Story 1: New Purchase Price vs. Appraised Value (Harris County)

**Situation:** Homeowner purchased in Spring, TX for $[PRICE]. HCAD appraised at $152K more than purchase price.
**Evidence presented:** Closing disclosure, PowerPoint with comps, repair estimates
**iSettle offer:** $17K above purchase price (close but not perfect)
**Mistake made:** Didn't accept iSettle offer in time
**ARB result:** Only reduced by $35K from noticed value — still $117K above purchase price
**Lesson:** **Accept the iSettle offer if it's close.** The ARB does NOT have to match your purchase price. The formal hearing can be worse than the informal offer.
**Next step taken:** Filed for binding arbitration. During the 45-day settlement period before actual arbitration, *"HCAD was willing to haggle and quickly came to a value close to what I was looking for. Got my $450 deposit back."*

### Story 2: Equity Argument with Neighborhood Comps (Generic Texas Metro)

**Situation:** Home assessed at $480K, owner believed worth $430K
**Evidence:** 
- Filed by April 25 (early)
- 3 comparable homes sold for $425K-$435K within quarter-mile
- Adjusted one comp by $5K for garage difference
- Photos and $12K HVAC repair estimate
- Corrected square footage error (2,600 → 2,400 sq ft = $30K overvaluation)
- Organized binder with summary, comp table, photos, map
**Informal result:** Appraiser lowered to $435K — saving $1,125/year
**Follow-up:** Applied for homestead exemption — additional $1,250 savings
**Total annual savings:** $2,375

### Story 3: Morning Appointment Magic (Harris County)

**Situation:** Reddit user went to HCAD for in-person hearing
**Evidence:** Standard comp set
**What happened:** *"It was crickets. Appraiser gave me more than I asked because her previous three clients didn't show."*
**Reduction:** Extra $30K beyond requested value
**Lesson:** **Morning appointments are golden.** When previous clients no-show, appraisers have time and may be more generous to clear the docket.

### Story 4: Mold Photos Win the Day (Austin/Travis County)

**Situation:** Homeowner had extensive mold requiring full bathroom demolition
**Evidence:** Photos of bathrooms stripped to bare studs, "with nought but a hole in the ground"
**ARB reaction:** Panel was visibly moved by the photos
**Result:** Value adjusted for condition
**Lesson:** **Dramatic condition photos work.** The more visceral the image, the more impact. Bare studs, water damage, cracks — these create emotional weight that supports your data.

### Story 5: Binding Arbitration as Leverage (Harris County)

**Situation:** Homeowner went through ARB, wasn't satisfied, filed for binding arbitration ($500 deposit)
**What happened:** *"A few weeks before arbitration hearing they said I had another chance to work something out with HCAD. I found that to be a much easier process and quickly came to a value close to what I was looking for."*
**Result:** Settled during the 45-day settlement period. Got $450 refund (only lost $50 admin fee).
**Lesson:** **Filing for arbitration creates serious leverage.** The CAD doesn't want to go to an independent arbitrator — they'll often settle during the 45-day window at a much better number.

### Story 6: DIY Equity Grid (Harris County)

**Situation:** Homeowner spent ~1 hour researching
**Evidence:** Found 5 houses in neighborhood with similar square footage, showed HCAD appraised theirs higher than the average
**Result:** HCAD settled — *"They're not getting me this year!"*
**Lesson:** Even simple equity research (1 hour) can produce results. You don't need to be a tax professional.

## 8. The Nuclear Option: Binding Arbitration & Judicial Appeal

### Binding Arbitration (Section 41A)

**What it is:** An independent arbitrator (not CAD, not ARB) hears your case and makes a binding decision.

**Eligibility requirements:**
- Property value (per ARB order) ≤ $5 million (no limit for residence homesteads)
- Protest was filed under §41.41(a)(1) or (2) — market value or unequal appraisal
- All taxes are current (not delinquent)
- No lawsuit filed on the same matter
- Must file within **60 days** of receiving the ARB written order

**Cost structure:**

| ARB Order Value | Required Deposit | Arbitrator Fee |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| $0 – $500K | $500 | $450 |
| $500K – $1M | $500 | $750 |
| $1M – $2M | $1,050 | $1,000 |
| $2M – $3M | $1,550 | $1,500 |
| $3M – $5M | $2,050 | $2,000 |

**Who pays:**
- **If you win** (arbitrator's value is nearer to YOUR opinion than the ARB's): You get your deposit back minus $50 admin fee. The CAD pays the arbitrator.
- **If you lose** (arbitrator's value is nearer to ARB's): Your deposit pays the arbitrator fee. Net cost to you: the deposit amount.

**Why it's powerful for homeowners:**
- No attorney required
- Arbitrators are truly independent (licensed appraisers or real estate agents, NOT CAD employees)
- $500 risk to potentially save thousands per year
- Per O'Connor Tax: *"The best feature of binding arbitration is the arbitrator will truly be independent of both the property owner and the appraisal district."*

**The Strategic Play: File for Arbitration Even If You Might Settle**

The 45-day settlement period after filing is where the magic happens:

> *"In past years I have found that during the time between filing for arbitration and the hearing, the CAD representative was willing to haggle over the valuation to avoid going to arbitration."* — Reddit user r/texas

The CAD has strong incentive to settle during this window:
- They have to pay the arbitrator if they lose
- An independent arbitrator may be less favorable to them than the ARB was
- It costs them staff time and resources
- Many CADs will offer significantly better settlements during arbitration settlement period

**If you settle during the 45-day window:** You get your deposit back minus $50.

**Filing tips:**
- Use the online system at texas.gov/propertytaxarbitration
- Or paper form AP-219 with cashier's check to Texas Comptroller
- **Your opinion of value on the form matters** — it sets the "midpoint" test for who wins
- You CAN state a higher value on the form and a lower value at the actual hearing (after further research)
- Per O'Connor: *"If you are not sure what value to request, err on a value at the high end of the range. Since you refined your opinion, you can reduce the value you actually request at the arbitration."*

### Judicial Appeal (District Court)

**When it makes sense:**
- Property value > $5 million (only option besides district court for high-value)
- Unequal appraisal issues that can't go to binding arbitration
- You have an attorney and the potential savings justify $5,000-$15,000+ in legal/expert costs
- The CAD committed procedural violations

**Cost reality:**
- Filing fees: ~$300
- Attorney fees: $2,000-$5,000
- Expert witness (appraiser): $3,000-$5,000
- **Total: $5,000-$15,000+**

**For most residential properties, binding arbitration is far more cost-effective.**

### SOAH (State Office of Administrative Hearings)

- Available for properties valued over $1 million in counties with population > 120,000
- Fees: ~$300-$1,000
- More formal than binding arbitration, less expensive than district court
- Rarely used for residential properties

### When to Threaten (But Not Bluff)

Simply **mentioning** at the informal stage that you plan to pursue binding arbitration if the ARB doesn't go your way can sometimes get a better informal offer. The appraiser knows:
- Arbitration costs the district money if they lose
- An independent arbitrator may be less sympathetic to the district
- It's more work for everyone

**But don't bluff.** Only mention arbitration if you're actually willing to file. Experienced appraisers can tell who's serious and who isn't.

### The Most Important Citation

**Texas Tax Code §42.26(a)(3)** — This is your best friend for equity protests. It explicitly allows you to argue that your property is not appraised equally with similar properties in the same neighborhood. You compare APPRAISED values (not sale prices), which is critical in Texas's non-disclosure state.

If anyone at the hearing tries to dismiss your equity evidence, say:

> "Section 42.26(a)(3) of the Texas Property Tax Code gives me the right to argue unequal appraisal by comparing my property's appraised value to the appraised values of comparable properties. I am exercising that right."

## Quick Reference: The Top 10 Rules for Winning

1. **State your number first.** Open with your requested value. Don't make them guess.
2. **Lead with your strongest evidence.** You have 5 minutes. Don't bury the lede.
3. **Use both market value AND equity arguments.** Double your chances.
4. **Bring 4 copies of everything.** One for you, one for each ARB member.
5. **Get the CAD's evidence 14 days before.** Know what you're up against.
6. **Practice to exactly 5 minutes.** Time yourself. Cut the fat.
7. **Stay factual, stay calm.** Emotion kills credibility.
8. **Reference page numbers.** "As shown on page 3..." keeps it organized.
9. **Know §42.26(a)(3) by heart.** The equity argument is your strongest legal weapon.
10. **File for binding arbitration if ARB fails.** The $500 deposit is leverage — CADs often settle during the 45-day window.
