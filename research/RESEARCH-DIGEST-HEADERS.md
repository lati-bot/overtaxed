## 1. How Professional Appraisers Select Comps

### USPAP Standards

The Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) governs appraisal methodology in the US. Key principles:

- **Standards Rule 1-4(a)**: "When a sales comparison approach is necessary for credible assignment results, an appraiser must analyze such comparable sales data as are available to indicate a value conclusion."
- **USPAP does NOT mandate specific methodologies** — it requires appraisers to be aware of, understand, and correctly employ recognized methods and techniques.
- **Three approaches** are recognized: Sales Comparison, Income, and Cost.
- **Sales Comparison** is the primary approach for residential property.
- Texas Property Tax Code §23.01 requires appraisal districts to comply with USPAP when using mass appraisal.

### IAAO Standards (Mass Appraisal)

The International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO) Standard on Mass Appraisal of Real Property provides the framework CADs use:

- **Comparable sales algorithms** are most akin to single-property appraisal applications.
- They have the advantage of being "familiar and easily explained."
- Models are used only to make adjustments to selected comparables.
- The **sales comparison approach is the best approach** for single-family residential property, including condominiums.
- Selection criteria for comparables in mass appraisal: **location (neighborhood/market area), property type, size, age, quality, and condition**.

### Texas Comptroller / PTAD Recommendations

- CADs are required to use USPAP-compliant mass appraisal methods.
- Properties must be valued at market value as of January 1 of the tax year.

## Executive Summary

**The gap in your current flow is enormous — and it's your biggest opportunity.**

Right now, you deliver the evidence package and abandon the customer at the most anxiety-filled moment of their journey. They've spent $49, they have a PDF, and they're staring at a government website wondering "did I do this right?"

The best consumer financial products (TurboTax, LegalZoom) don't just deliver a product — they **guide the customer through the entire outcome**. TurboTax doesn't stop at filing; they send "track your refund" emails. LegalZoom doesn't stop at document creation; they send "here's what to do next" sequences.

**Your $49 product should feel like a $500 service.** The evidence package is the deliverable. The *experience* is everything that wraps around it.

The research points to **10-12 emails across the full lifecycle** (purchase → filing → hearing → post-hearing → next year), with the goal of making every customer feel guided, supported, and confident at every step. This is how you turn a one-time purchase into an annual relationship worth $200+ in lifetime value.

## 1. What the Best Consumer Legal/Financial Products Do Post-Purchase

### TurboTax — The Gold Standard
TurboTax is the closest analog to Overtaxed. They take a dreaded, complex government process and make it feel achievable. Key post-purchase tactics:

- **Goal-oriented messaging**: Every communication centers on the outcome ("Your maximum refund, guaranteed"), not the process. For Overtaxed, this means leading with "$X saved on your tax bill" not "evidence package delivered."
- **Progress tracking after completion**: After filing, TurboTax sends "Start tracking your refund today!" — this keeps users engaged and reduces anxiety. Equivalent for us: "Track your protest status."
- **"We're with you all year" positioning**: TurboTax explicitly says "TurboTax is here to help—even when your taxes are done." This transforms a seasonal product into a year-round relationship.
- **Milestone celebrations**: Every completed step gets acknowledged. "Woohoo! Your federal return is filed!" creates dopamine hits and reinforces the decision to purchase.
- **Cross-sell through value**: They follow up with complementary tools (Turbo for credit monitoring) only after delivering core value. For us: referral program or next-year monitoring only after the protest outcome.

## 1. What Is the CAD Evidence Packet?

The CAD evidence packet is the **County Appraisal District's case file** — the set of documents, data, and exhibits they will present to the Appraisal Review Board (ARB) to justify their appraised value of your property.

Think of it as the prosecution's case in a trial, except **they're required to show it to you before the hearing**.

### Key Facts

- **Typical size:** 5–15 pages for residential; 20–100+ pages for commercial
- **Format:** PDF (online portal) or printed packet (mail/in-person)
- **When available:** Must be provided at least **14 days before your hearing** (§41.461)
- **Cost:** **FREE** — as of HB 988 (2021), the CAD may not charge for copies regardless of delivery method (§41.461(b))

### What It Is NOT

- It is NOT a comprehensive appraisal report like a lender would produce
- It is NOT unbiased — it's built to support THEIR number
- It is NOT always accurate — errors are extremely common
- It is NOT final — you can challenge every piece of it

## 1. Condition Issues That Reduce Value

### Foundation Issues
- **Value impact:** 10–25% reduction in market value
- **Typical repair cost (Texas):** $3,300–$15,000 (moderate); up to $25,000+ for severe
- **Signs:** Cracks in walls/floors, uneven flooring, doors that stick, settling
- **Why it matters at ARB:** Foundation is THE #1 structural concern. A $300,000 home with foundation issues can lose $30,000–$75,000 in value instantly
- **Texas-specific:** Texas expansive clay soil makes foundation problems extremely common. ARB panels are very familiar with this issue
- **Pier work:** Steel piers average $1,200–$1,500 per pier; most homes need 8–15 piers ($10,000–$22,500)

### Roof Damage / Age
- **Value impact:** 5–15% reduction depending on severity
- **Typical repair cost:** $500–$3,000 (repair); $7,000–$15,000+ (full replacement, Texas)
- **Signs:** Missing/damaged shingles, leaks, visible wear, age >15 years for composition
- **Why it matters:** Old or damaged roof signals deferred maintenance AND potential hidden water damage
- **Expected lifespan:** Composition shingles 15–25 years; tile 40–50 years
- **Hail damage:** Very common in Texas; can require full replacement even on newer roofs

### HVAC System
- **Value impact:** $5,000–$10,000 reduction for failing/outdated system
- **Typical replacement cost:** $5,000–$10,000 (full system, Texas)
- **Age threshold:** Appraisers flag systems >13 years old; "old" at 10+ years
- **Why it matters:** In Texas, a working A/C is not optional — it's essential. Buyers deduct full replacement cost
- **ROI insight:** Homeowners recoup only 40–60% of HVAC investment in added value — meaning a failing system costs MORE than replacement price in lost value

### Plumbing Issues
- **Value impact:** 5–10% for major issues; cost-of-repair for minor
- **Typical repair cost:** $150 (minor); $3,000–$5,000+ (major); $4,000–$15,000 (full re-pipe)
- **Red flags:** Galvanized pipes (pre-1970s homes), sewer line issues, visible leaks, low water pressure

## 1. Texas Homestead Exemption — Current Law

### Current Amounts (Effective January 1, 2025 — Prop 13 + Prop 11 passed Nov 2025)

| Exemption Type | Amount | Applies To |
|----------------|--------|------------|
| **General Homestead (School District)** | **$140,000** | All homeowners (was $100K in 2024, $40K before 2023) |
| **Over-65 / Disabled Additional (School)** | **$60,000** | On top of general = **$200,000 total** for seniors/disabled (was $10K add-on before 2025) |
| **County (FM/Flood Control)** | $3,000 | Mandatory for counties collecting FM/flood taxes |
| **Local Option (Any taxing unit)** | Up to 20% of appraised value (min $5,000) | Optional — cities, counties, special districts may adopt |
| **Over-65/Disabled Local Option** | At least $3,000 | Any taxing unit can adopt |

### Key Legal References
- **Texas Tax Code §11.13(b)** — School district general homestead ($140,000)
- **Texas Tax Code §11.13(c)** — School district over-65/disabled additional ($60,000)
- **Texas Tax Code §11.13(n)** — Local option up to 20% of value
- **Texas Tax Code §11.13(a)** — County FM/flood control ($3,000)
- **Texas Tax Code §23.23** — 10% annual cap on appraised value increases

### What Qualifies
- Must be your **principal residence** (owner-occupied)
- Must have **ownership interest** in the property
- Texas driver's license or ID must match property address
- Cannot claim homestead on another property (in or outside TX)
- Applies to up to **20 acres** of residential land
- If you buy after Jan 1, you can still get a prorated exemption for that year

### Total Potential Savings (Example: $400K Home)

For a home appraised at $400,000 with a **2.2% total tax rate** (typical for suburban TX):

========== PRECOMPUTE-AUDIT ==========
# Precompute Script Audit — Comparable Property Selection Quality

**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Auditor:** Automation (subagent)  
**Deadline context:** May 15, 2026 protest filing deadline  
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether our precomputed comps would survive scrutiny at an ARB hearing

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Grade: C+**

Our comp selection is *functional but fragile*. The core approach — same neighborhood, similar size, sorted by lowest $/sqft — is the right skeleton for a §42.26 equity protest. But there are enough gaps that a prepared ARB panel or district appraiser could pick apart our evidence. The biggest risks:

1. **±25% sqft filter is too loose** (industry standard is ±20%)
2. **Zero age/year-built filtering** — a 1960 ranch vs. 2022 new construction would match
3. **Cherry-picking the 5 lowest $/sqft** — obvious advocacy bias an ARB will spot
4. **No fallback strategy** when neighborhoods have few properties
5. **Rockwall has no sqft data at all** — comps are based solely on value proximity

None of these are fatal for an automated mass-protest tool, but they limit our credibility for borderline cases where the ARB is looking for reasons to deny.

---

## 1. Houston (Harris County — HCAD)

**Script:** `property-tax-appeal/houston/precompute_houston.py`

### Current Methodology Summary
Groups properties by HCAD `Neighborhood_Code`. Filters comps to ±25% sqft within the same neighborhood. Selects the 5 lowest $/sqft properties as comps. Calculates fair value as neighborhood median $/sqft × subject sqft.

### Comp Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Area grouping | `Neighborhood_Code` | HCAD's own neighborhood delineation |
| Size filter | ±25% sqft | Looser than standard |
| Age filter | **None** | ❌ Critical gap |
| Value filter | None | Implicit via neighborhood |
| Comp count | 5 | Reasonable |
| Sort/rank | Lowest $/sqft first | Cherry-picking bias |

### Strengths
- Uses HCAD's official neighborhood codes, which are the same groupings the district uses internally — good alignment with how HCAD appraisers think
- Median $/sqft is a defensible metric for equity protests under Texas Property Tax Code §42.26
- Residential filter (`state_class` starting with A or B) correctly excludes commercial/industrial
- Simple, fast, reliable — processes hundreds of thousands of properties

## 1. ACTUAL SAMPLE EVIDENCE DOCUMENTS FOUND

### A. Square Deal (squaredeal.tax) — THE GOLD STANDARD FOR DIY

**Sample PDFs found publicly:**
- `https://squaredeal.tax/assets/sample_appeal_evidence_tx_dallas.pdf`
- `https://squaredeal.tax/assets/sample_appeal_evidence_tx_collin.pdf`

**What we know about their format (from blog + marketing):**
- **Title:** "Property Tax Protest Evidence [Year]"
- **Page 1:** Subject Property Summary — address, account number, neighborhood code, noticed appraised value, $/sqft
- **Page 2:** Highlights/Quick Stats — key talking points for the hearing:
  - "All comps are in the same neighborhood as Subject (e.g., Neighborhood Code 7932.04)"
  - "Comps are within ±X years of Subject's year built"
  - "All comps are located within X miles of Subject"
  - "Living areas are within ±X sqft"
  - "Same construction quality (e.g., 'Average')"
  - "Same construction grade (e.g., 'C+')"
  - "Similar CDU (Condition, Desirability, Utility)"
- **Subsequent pages:** Equity Comparable Grid (appraised values comparison) + Market Sales Grid
- **Includes:** Neighborhood map showing comp locations
- **Visual style:** Clean, data-driven, tabular. Professional but not flashy
- **Pricing:** ~$20-40 per report

**Why it's effective:**
- Uses OFFICIAL CAD data (account numbers, neighborhood codes, CDU ratings)
- Speaks the appraiser's language — same terminology they use
- Pre-written talking points owner can read verbatim

========== MARKET-VALUE-ARGUMENT-RESEARCH ==========
# Market Value Argument Research: Building a Dual-Argument Powerhouse

**Goal:** Add a market value argument alongside our existing equity/uniformity argument (§42.26) to give customers the best possible chance of reducing their property taxes.

**Key Insight:** Filing BOTH equity AND market value preserves maximum appeal rights and gives the ARB two independent reasons to reduce value. Texas Law Help (composed by Texas A&M TRERC) explicitly recommends checking "incorrect appraised (market) value **and/or** value is unequal compared with other properties" on Form 50-132 to "present the widest types of evidence and preserve your full appeal rights."

## 1. How Professional Firms Build Market Value Cases

### O'Connor & Associates
- **The biggest TX property tax firm** — saved clients over $213 million in 2025
- O'Connor has **licensed real estate agents on staff** who have MLS access
- They also purchase data from **third-party vendors** (CoreLogic, ATTOM, Black Knight)
- They employ **all three approaches**: sales comparison, cost, and income (for commercial)
- For residential, they primarily use equity/uniformity **and** sales comparison
- They pursue cases through all 3 phases: informal → ARB → litigation/binding arbitration
- They staff hundreds of agents who attend hearings daily across Texas

### Ownwell
- Technology-focused firm using **"proprietary software and big-data analysis"**
- Published research showing TX market values fell ~14% cumulative since 2022 while assessed values kept rising
- Likely uses a combination of **licensed agent MLS access + data vendor feeds + public CAD data**
- Their insights reports show they track market value vs. assessed value gaps by price band and county

### Texas Tax Protest
- Claims to use **"advanced data tools"** combined with "hands-on support"
- Employs "big-data analysis to identify discrepancies in appraisals"
- Recommends clients gather comps from **realtors, the CAD's evidence packet, and online tools**

### How They All Do It — The Playbook
1. **MLS Access:** Most large firms have licensed agents or broker partnerships that provide direct MLS access to sold data
2. **Data Vendors:** Purchase sales data from CoreLogic, ATTOM, or Black Knight (which aggregate MLS data from across the country)
3. **CAD Evidence Packets:** Use §41.461 to obtain the CAD's own sales comps, then turn them against the CAD
4. **Volume Advantage:** Because they handle thousands of cases, they accumulate sales knowledge across neighborhoods

## 1. Design Philosophy

### The Problem We're Solving
Current packet is a monolithic PDF mixing evidence (for the appraiser/board) with instructions (for the homeowner). Customer feedback (Deji, Feb 2026): *"The PDF is a lot to digest. The avg user is already overwhelmed and just wants simple dumbed down steps."*

### The Solution: Two Documents
Split into **two PDFs** delivered together:

| Document | Purpose | Audience | Pages |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| **Evidence Packet** | Submit to CAD/Board | Appraiser, ARB panel, Board of Review | 4–5 pages |
| **Homeowner Playbook** | Prepare & win | The homeowner only | 4–6 pages |

**Why two documents:**
1. The Evidence Packet is what you hand to the appraiser. It should look professional, authoritative, and contain ONLY evidence + legal argument. No hearing scripts, no "how to file" instructions.
2. The Homeowner Playbook is the homeowner's private strategy guide. Hearing script, rebuttal guide, process timeline, CAD evidence request instructions, condition documentation guide. The appraiser never sees this.

### Page Count Target
- Evidence Packet: **4–5 pages** (lean, authoritative, no filler)
- Homeowner Playbook: **4–6 pages** (comprehensive but scannable)
- **Total: 8–10 pages across both PDFs**

## 1. The 5-Minute ARB Hearing Script

### The Setup: What You Walk Into

- **Who's there:** 3 ARB panel members (local citizens appointed by a judge), 1 CAD appraiser, and you
- **Total hearing time:** ~15 minutes shared. You get approximately **5 minutes** for your presentation, then the appraiser gets ~5 minutes, then brief rebuttals and deliberation
- **Format:** Both sides sworn in → you present → appraiser presents → rebuttals → deliberation → decision announced verbally on the spot

### The Script (Verbatim Template)

**[Opening — 30 seconds]**

> "Thank you, members of the Board. My name is [NAME], and I'm the owner of [ADDRESS], account number [ACCOUNT #]. I'm protesting both the market value and the unequal appraisal of my property. The district has appraised my home at $[NOTICED VALUE]. Based on my evidence, I'm requesting a value of $[YOUR OPINION OF VALUE]. I've provided copies of my evidence for each of you."

*Hand evidence packets to each of the 3 ARB members if in-person. If virtual, confirm they have the uploaded documents.*

**[Errors in Property Record — 30 seconds, if applicable]**

> "First, I'd like to point out [NUMBER] errors in the district's property record. The district lists my home as [WRONG DETAIL — e.g., 2,600 sq ft], but it's actually [CORRECT DETAIL — e.g., 2,400 sq ft] as shown in [SOURCE — survey/blueprints/deed]. This alone accounts for approximately $[DOLLAR AMOUNT] in overvaluation."

**[Comparable Sales Evidence — 90 seconds]**

> "Turning to page [X] of my evidence packet, I've identified [3-5] comparable sales within [distance] of my property, all sold within the last 12 months. As you can see in my comparison table:
> - [COMP 1 ADDRESS] — sold for $[PRICE] on [DATE], [SQ FT], built [YEAR]
> - [COMP 2 ADDRESS] — sold for $[PRICE] on [DATE], [SQ FT], built [YEAR]  
> - [COMP 3 ADDRESS] — sold for $[PRICE] on [DATE], [SQ FT], built [YEAR]

========== COUNTY-PORTALS-RESEARCH ==========
# Texas County Appraisal District — Online Protest Portal Research

> **Researched:** February 17, 2026  
> **Purpose:** Document exact online protest filing processes for 10 major TX counties  
> **Note:** Some portal details (exact screen flows) can only be observed after logging in with a real account during protest season (typically April 15 – May 15). This research captures everything discoverable from public-facing pages, official help docs, and third-party guides.

## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity
Texas property tax protests have an **~85-90% success rate** when evidence is properly presented. Between 30-60% of residential properties are overassessed by county appraisal districts that rely on Computer-Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) systems. Yet fewer than 25% of homeowners file protests, and fewer than 5% nationally do so. This represents a massive, underserved market.

### What Wins Protests
After exhaustive research across all 10 counties, the evidence is clear:

1. **Equity comp grids** (uniform & equal argument under §42.26) are the single most powerful tool for residential protests. This compares the subject property's $/sqft appraised value to the median of 5-10 similar properties on the same tax roll, appropriately adjusted.

2. **Sales comp analysis** (market value argument under §41.43) using 3-5 recent arms-length sales within 0.5-1 mile, adjusted for differences.

3. **Property condition documentation** — photos of deferred maintenance, repair estimates, functional/external obsolescence.

4. **Record error corrections** — wrong square footage, bed/bath count, quality/condition codes.

### What a $49 Package Must Include to Compete
Based on our analysis of professional firms (Ownwell, O'Connor/CutMyTaxes, Texas Protax, NTPTS, Home Tax Shield) and direct competitors (AppealDesk at $49, SquareDeal at ~$30-50/report, TaxLasso at $0 filing fee), a competitive $49 package needs:

| Component | Must Have | Nice to Have |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Equity comp grid (5-10 comps, adjusted) | ✅ CRITICAL | — |
| Sales comp analysis (3-5 comps) | ✅ CRITICAL | — |
| Property record audit (sqft, beds, baths) | ✅ CRITICAL | — |
| County-specific filing instructions | ✅ CRITICAL | — |
| Pre-written protest letter / cover sheet | ✅ | — |
| $/sqft analysis with median calculation | ✅ | — |
| Opinion of value recommendation | ✅ | — |
| Neighborhood map showing comp locations | — | ✅ |

========== COOK-COUNTY-APPEAL-AUDIT ==========
# Cook County Property Tax Appeal Package Audit
## Comprehensive Research Report for Overtaxed ($49 Appeal/Evidence Packages)

**Date:** February 17, 2026  
**Market:** Cook County, IL (~971K properties in database)  
**Product:** $49 pre-built appeal/evidence packages for homeowners

---

## Executive Summary

Cook County has the **most complex property tax assessment system in the United States**, and it's also one of the most appeal-friendly. Key findings:

1. **The market is enormous and underserved.** Cook County has 1.8M+ parcels. Only ~27% of homeowners appeal their taxes annually vs. 64% for commercial. There's a massive untapped residential market.

2. **Success rates are remarkably high.** ~56% of all appeals filed see a reduction. Professional firms claim 77-90% success rates. The BOR has historically granted relief in ~62% of cases.

3. **The two-bite system is unique.** Cook County homeowners can appeal TWICE per year — first to the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO), then to the Cook County Board of Review (CCBOR). Each is independent. Reductions are cumulative.

4. **Residential appeals are simpler than commercial.** Class 2 residential appeals don't require a brief, income data, or a Historical Summary Form. The bar for homeowners is intentionally low.

5. **Our $49 package is competitively positioned but needs to deliver professional-grade evidence.** Competitors charge 25-50% of savings (contingency) or flat fees of $300+. Our flat-fee model is dramatically cheaper. The key is providing evidence that matches what professional firms compile.

6. **Comparable properties are EVERYTHING.** Both the CCAO and CCBOR evaluate appeals primarily on comparable property analysis — either uniformity (assessed value comparisons) or market value (sales comparisons).

## Part 1: Cook County Board of Review (CCBOR) Process — Deep Dive

### 1.1 What the CCBOR Evaluates

The CCBOR is a **separate, quasi-judicial agency independent of the Assessor**. After the Assessor completes township reassessments, property owners may appeal to the BOR. The BOR's decision sets the **final county valuation** for that tax year.

The BOR evaluates:
- **Uniformity of assessment** — Is the property assessed higher per square foot than comparable properties?
- **Market value / overvaluation** — Is the assessed market value higher than actual market value based on recent sales?
- **Factual errors** — Incorrect square footage, wrong number of rooms, incorrect classification
- **Recent purchase price** — If purchased within 3 years in an arm's-length transaction for less than assessed value
- **Special circumstances** — Fire, flood, demolition, vacancy

**Critical insight: The BOR is NOT bound by the Assessor's final determination.** You can appeal to the BOR regardless of whether the Assessor granted or denied your appeal. You are at no disadvantage.

### 1.2 Filing Requirements & Forms

#### For Residential (Class 2) Appeals:
- **Official Complaint Form** — Must use the BOR's prescribed form (available for download or online filing). No reproductions accepted.
- **Online filing** — Available at https://appeals.cookcountyboardofreview.com/
- **Duplicate filing** — Paper forms must be filed in duplicate; online filing doesn't require duplicates
- **Separate complaints** — One per property/PIN (multiple related PINs can be on one form)
- **Signature required** — By taxpayer or attorney

========== COMPETITOR-TEARDOWN ==========
# Competitor Product Teardown: Property Tax Protest/Appeal Services

**Prepared:** February 17, 2026
**Product:** Overtaxed (getovertaxed.com) — $49 protest/evidence packages
**Purpose:** Understand what competitors deliver, how they price, and where Overtaxed fits

---

## Executive Summary

The property tax protest industry has three distinct tiers:

1. **Full-service contingency firms** (Ownwell, Texas Protax, O'Connor, NTPTS, Home Tax Shield) — They file, attend hearings, negotiate. Charge 25–50% of savings. Customer does nothing.
2. **Flat-fee evidence/DIY packages** (AppealDesk, PropertyTaxReduction/Rainbolt, TaxLasso, DIY Tax Appeals LLC, SquareDeal.tax) — They provide comp analysis and evidence docs. Customer files themselves. $49–$160 flat fee.
3. **Free services** (Chandler Crouch/FreeTaxProtest.com) — Realtor-funded, Tarrant County only. Completely free.

**Overtaxed at $49 sits squarely in Tier 2** — and faces a direct, nearly identical competitor in **AppealDesk** ($49, same model, same deliverables). PropertyTaxReduction.com charges $59.95 for a similar report.

**Key finding:** The biggest gap between Overtaxed/Tier 2 and the full-service firms isn't the evidence quality — it's the **hearing representation**. Most homeowners are scared of hearings and value someone else showing up. The evidence packages from flat-fee services are often comparable or identical to what the big firms use.

**The opportunity:** Overtaxed can beat every competitor in Tier 2 on deliverable quality and match Tier 1 on evidence quality, while charging 5–10x less. The specific gaps to close are: unequal appraisal analysis, condition/CDU adjustments, and county-specific filing automation.

# Overtaxed Protest Quality Research — Consolidated Blueprint
## Synthesis of TX Protest Audit, Cook County Appeal Audit, and Competitor Teardown
### February 17, 2026 | TX Deadline: May 15, 2026

## Section 1: What Does a World-Class Protest Package Look Like?

Based on research across all 10 TX counties, Cook County IL, 9+ competitors, and actual ARB/BOR evidence standards, the **ideal $49 protest package** would contain:

### The 4-Deliverable Model

**Deliverable 1: Evidence Packet (PDF, 4-6 pages)**
The core product. Must include:

1. **Cover Page / Protest Letter** — Pre-written, professional, references all attached evidence. Includes property details, opinion of value, and the specific legal grounds being argued.

2. **Equity/Uniformity Analysis (§42.26 for TX / 35 ILCS 200/16-70 for IL)**
   - Subject property details (address, account#, appraised value, sqft, $/sqft, key characteristics)
   - 5-10 comparable properties from the SAME tax roll
   - Table format: address, account#, appraised value, sqft, $/sqft, year built, beds/baths (where available), adjustments, adjusted value
   - Median comp $/sqft calculation
   - Clear statement: "Subject is assessed at $X/sqft vs median of $Y/sqft among comparable properties"
   - This is the MOST POWERFUL argument in TX — uses public CAD data, sidesteps non-disclosure

3. **Market Value Analysis (§41.43 for TX)**
   - Where sales data is available: 3-5 recent comparable sales
   - Adjusted sale prices with $/sqft calculations
   - Where sales data is NOT available (most TX counties due to non-disclosure): guide homeowner to request CAD's evidence packet (which contains their sales comps) 14 days before hearing, then use those against them

4. **Property Record Audit**
   - CAD's recorded characteristics vs what we know
   - Flag potential errors (sqft discrepancies, incorrect features)
   - Calculated impact of errors on value
   - Prompt homeowner to verify and photograph any issues

**Deliverable 2: County Filing Guide (PDF, 2-3 pages)**
- County-specific step-by-step portal instructions
- Which boxes to check (ALWAYS check BOTH market value AND unequal appraisal)
- How to enter opinion of value
- Where to upload evidence
- Key deadlines
- How to request the CAD's evidence packet

**Deliverable 3: Hearing Preparation Guide (PDF, 1-2 pages)**
- What to expect at informal hearing vs formal ARB
- 5-minute presentation script ("Here's exactly what to say")
- Common appraiser rebuttals and how to counter them
- What NOT to say (don't discuss tax bill amount, don't get emotional, don't compare to Zillow)
- How to negotiate a settlement at informal
