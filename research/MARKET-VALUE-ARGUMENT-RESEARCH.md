# Market Value Argument Research: Building a Dual-Argument Powerhouse

**Goal:** Add a market value argument alongside our existing equity/uniformity argument (§42.26) to give customers the best possible chance of reducing their property taxes.

**Key Insight:** Filing BOTH equity AND market value preserves maximum appeal rights and gives the ARB two independent reasons to reduce value. Texas Law Help (composed by Texas A&M TRERC) explicitly recommends checking "incorrect appraised (market) value **and/or** value is unequal compared with other properties" on Form 50-132 to "present the widest types of evidence and preserve your full appeal rights."

## 1. How Professional Firms Build Market Value Cases

### O'Connor & Associates
- **The biggest TX property tax firm** — saved clients over $213 million in 2025
- O'Connor has **licensed real estate agents on staff** who have MLS access
- They also purchase data from **third-party vendors** (CoreLogic, ATTOM, Black Knight)
- They employ **all three approaches**: sales comparison, cost, and income (for commercial)
- For residential, they primarily use equity/uniformity **and** sales comparison
- They pursue cases through all 3 phases: informal → ARB → litigation/binding arbitration
- They staff hundreds of agents who attend hearings daily across Texas

### Ownwell
- Technology-focused firm using **"proprietary software and big-data analysis"**
- Published research showing TX market values fell ~14% cumulative since 2022 while assessed values kept rising
- Likely uses a combination of **licensed agent MLS access + data vendor feeds + public CAD data**
- Their insights reports show they track market value vs. assessed value gaps by price band and county

### Texas Tax Protest
- Claims to use **"advanced data tools"** combined with "hands-on support"
- Employs "big-data analysis to identify discrepancies in appraisals"
- Recommends clients gather comps from **realtors, the CAD's evidence packet, and online tools**

### How They All Do It — The Playbook
1. **MLS Access:** Most large firms have licensed agents or broker partnerships that provide direct MLS access to sold data
2. **Data Vendors:** Purchase sales data from CoreLogic, ATTOM, or Black Knight (which aggregate MLS data from across the country)
3. **CAD Evidence Packets:** Use §41.461 to obtain the CAD's own sales comps, then turn them against the CAD
4. **Volume Advantage:** Because they handle thousands of cases, they accumulate sales knowledge across neighborhoods

### What This Means for Overtaxed
We don't have MLS access or data vendor licenses (yet). But we have **three viable paths** to market value arguments without them:
1. Leverage the CAD's own evidence packet (§41.461)
2. Guide customers to provide their own purchase data
3. Use market condition evidence (declining markets, interest rates)
4. Use the cost approach where applicable

## 2. Free/Public Sources of Sales Data in Texas

### Deed Filings at County Clerk
- **Sale price is NOT recorded on Texas deeds.** Texas deeds only show grantor, grantee, legal description, and consideration (usually stated as "$10 and other good and valuable consideration")
- **Not useful for getting sale prices**

### Mortgage/Deed of Trust Filings
- **Deed of Trust amounts ARE public record** at the county clerk
- The loan amount establishes a **floor price** (most buyers put 5-20% down, so purchase price ≥ loan amount)
- For conventional loans with 20% down: purchase price ≈ loan amount / 0.80
- For FHA with 3.5% down: purchase price ≈ loan amount / 0.965
- **Limitations:** Cash purchases have no deed of trust; refinances muddy the data; doesn't capture exact price
- **Verdict: Useful as a rough proxy, not reliable enough for formal evidence**

### Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com
- **Texas is a non-disclosure state** — these sites **cannot legally display home sale prices publicly** for Texas properties
- Zillow shows Zestimates (algorithm-based estimates) but NOT actual sold prices in TX
- Redfin historically showed some sold prices in TX (sourced from MLS feeds) but this has become restricted
- Per SquareDeal.tax: "Portals like Zillow don't publish Texas sold prices as public record; MLS holds the data"
- Zillow's Zestimate accuracy in Texas is **particularly poor** because it relies on tax values instead of sale prices (circular logic!)
- **Verdict: Zestimates are NOT usable as evidence at ARB. They could mislead homeowners.**
- **However:** These sites DO show listing prices and days-on-market, which CAN support market condition arguments

### ATTOM Data
- **Property Navigator:** $499/year for Professional plan (200 reports/mo, 2,000 list exports/mo)
- **API Access:** ~$500/month for basic API (per dataset + volume); $10,000+/month for large-scale nationwide data
- Covers sales data, mortgage data, foreclosures, AVMs nationwide
- **Cheaper alternatives exist:** Realie.ai, BatchData, Homesage.ai (~$100/month for lighter usage)
- **Verdict: Feasible for a startup but probably premature. Revisit when we have revenue to justify the cost.**

### CoreLogic / Black Knight
- Enterprise-level pricing (custom contracts, typically $thousands/month minimum)
- Most comprehensive data but designed for large firms
- **Verdict: Too expensive for current stage**

### Texas A&M Real Estate Center (TRERC)
- Publishes **aggregate market statistics** (median prices, volume, inventory) by metro area and county
- Does NOT publish individual sale prices
- Their data IS useful for **market condition arguments** (see Section 5)
- Free at: https://trerc.tamu.edu

### Texas Comptroller Property Tax Reports
- Publishes annual property tax data reports and survey results
- Includes aggregate assessment data, protest statistics, etc.
- NOT individual sales data
- **Verdict: Useful for macro-level market trend arguments**

### Counties That Might Publish Sales Data
- Some CADs (like Cook County in IL) publish their sales data openly — **no TX county does this**
- CADs in TX purchase MLS data through broker agreements and third-party vendors
- Per SquareDeal.tax: "CADs buy the data anyway. You just pay for it indirectly"
- Gov't Code §552.149 specifically **exempts** sales data received by CADs from private entities from public disclosure

## 3. Using the CAD's Evidence Against Them

### The §41.461 Power Play — THIS IS OUR BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY

**Texas Tax Code §41.461** requires the chief appraiser to deliver ALL evidence they plan to present **at least 14 days before the ARB hearing**. This evidence packet typically contains:

#### What's in the CAD Evidence Packet:
1. **Property Record Card (PRC)** — CAD's official record (sq ft, year built, features, condition rating)
2. **Sales Comparables Grid** — Recent sales the CAD claims support their value ⭐
3. **Equity Comparables Grid** — Similar properties and their appraised values/sqft
4. **Adjustment Tables** — CAD's internal formulas for adjusting between properties
5. **Photos** — Street-view or aerial of subject and comps
6. **Maps** — Location of subject and comps
7. **Other** — MLS listings, building permits, market trend reports

#### Why This Is Gold
- **The CAD is giving you THEIR sales comps** — the very data that's otherwise locked behind non-disclosure laws
- If you requested CAD evidence, they **cannot present ANY evidence at the hearing that wasn't in the packet** (§41.67(d))
- You get 14 days to study, critique, and prepare rebuttals

#### How to Turn CAD's Sales Comps Against Them

**1. Check Sale Ratios:**
- Sale ratio = CAD's appraised value of comp ÷ actual sale price
- If ratios are inconsistent (some above 1.00, some below), CAD's own analysis is unreliable
- If the median sale ratio of their comps is < 1.00, their own data proves they're overvaluing properties

**2. Cherry-Picking Detection:**
- CADs often select higher-value sales or comps from different neighborhoods
- Check if all comps are in the same neighborhood, school district, and zip code
- Flag comps that are significantly different in size, age, or condition

**3. The "Stale Comps" Problem:**
- CAD builds evidence packets using **preliminary values** from early in protest season
- Many of those comps get **reduced after their own protests**
- CAD doesn't update grids — they may use inflated numbers against you
- **Strategy:** Before the hearing, look up each comp in the CAD's public database. Print current (post-protest) values. Show the ARB that CAD's evidence is outdated.

**4. Adjustment Challenges:**
- CAD's adjustments may be inconsistent or unrealistic
- If they add $40/sqft for extra living area in one comp but $25/sqft in another — challenge this
- If their adjustments are applied unevenly, point it out

**5. Re-calculate Using Their Own Comps:**
- Take the CAD's sales comps
- Apply YOUR adjustments (or even their own adjustments more consistently)
- Show that even their chosen comps support a LOWER value than what they appraised

### What We Should Build for Customers
- **Template letter** to request §41.461 evidence packet (send with protest filing)
- **Guide to reading the CAD evidence packet** — what to look for, what to challenge
- **Worksheet/checklist** for analyzing CAD's sales comps
- **Scripts** for the ARB hearing: "The CAD's own comparable at 123 Oak St sold for $X, which after adjustments supports a value of $Y for my property — lower than their appraisal"

---

## 4. The "Recent Purchase" Argument

### The Strongest Market Value Evidence Available

If a homeowner bought their property recently for less than the CAD's appraised value, this is **the single strongest market value evidence** they can present. An arm's-length transaction is the textbook definition of market value.

### How Recent Is "Recent"?
- **Within 6 months of Jan 1 (appraisal date):** Extremely strong — almost impossible for the CAD to rebut
- **Within 1 year:** Very strong — ARBs generally accept this without question
- **Within 2 years:** Strong, but may need supporting evidence that market hasn't risen significantly since purchase
- **Within 3 years:** Acceptable but weaker — should pair with market condition evidence showing flat/declining values
- **Beyond 3 years:** Generally not persuasive on its own unless paired with evidence of market decline

**Best practice:** Use purchase price for homes bought within **24 months of the January 1 appraisal date**

### Required Documentation
- **Closing Disclosure (CD)** — post-2015 transactions; shows final purchase price and all terms
- **HUD-1 Settlement Statement** — pre-2015 transactions; same purpose
- **Sales Contract** — showing agreed purchase price
- **Proof of arm's-length transaction** — not between related parties, not foreclosure/short sale (unless you want to argue distressed market conditions)

### How ARBs Treat Purchase Price
- **Most ARBs give strong weight to recent arm's-length purchases** — it IS the market speaking
- The CAD may try to argue:
  - "You got a deal" (rebuttal: the market IS the collective of such transactions)
  - "Market has risen since purchase" (rebuttal: show market data proving otherwise)
  - "The sale wasn't arm's-length" (rebuttal: provide closing docs showing conventional financing, no family relationship)
- **Per the Comptroller's definition of market value** (Tax Code §23.01): Market value IS what a property would sell for in an open market transaction — your actual sale IS that evidence

### What We Should Build for Customers
- **Prompt in the intake flow:** "Did you purchase this property in the last 3 years? If so, provide your closing disclosure."
- **Automated argument generation:** If purchase price < appraised value AND purchase was within 24 months, include market value argument automatically
- **Template language** for the hearing: "I purchased this property on [date] for $[price] in an arm's-length transaction. My closing disclosure is attached. This represents the market value as of the date of sale. The CAD's appraised value of $[appraised] exceeds the actual market transaction by $[difference]."

---

## 5. Market Condition Evidence

### The Macro Argument — No Sales Data Required

Even without specific sales comps, you can argue that market conditions don't support the CAD's appraised value. This is particularly powerful in declining or flat markets.

### Available Data Sources (FREE)

**1. Texas A&M Real Estate Center (TRERC)**
- Monthly housing activity reports by metro and county
- Median price, sales volume, inventory, days on market
- Free at: https://trerc.tamu.edu/housing-activity/
- Shows trends over time — perfect for "market has declined" arguments

**2. Ownwell's Published Research**
- Shows that Texas market values fell ~14% cumulative since 2022 while assessed values kept rising
- Gap between market value and assessed value changes documented by county and price band
- Example (Bexar County 2023-2024): Market value 0% change, Assessed value +7.59% change = 7.59% gap

**3. Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**
- Mortgage rate data — show how rising rates reduce purchasing power
- When rates go from 3% to 7%, the same monthly payment buys a much cheaper house
- A $400K house at 3% has same payment as a ~$270K house at 7%
- This directly quantifies market value decline

**4. Realtor.com / Redfin Market Data**
- Monthly market reports with median list price, inventory, days on market
- Available by metro area and sometimes zip code
- These show LIST prices (not sold) — still useful for trend evidence

**5. Local Market Statistics**
- **Days on market increasing** = weakening demand = lower values
- **Inventory rising** = more supply = downward price pressure
- **Price reductions increasing** = sellers can't get asking prices
- All of these are publicly available from TRERC and real estate market reports

### How to Frame Market Condition Arguments
- "Since the January 1 appraisal date, mortgage rates have risen from X% to Y%, reducing buyer purchasing power by Z%"
- "According to Texas A&M Real Estate Center data, median home prices in [county] have declined X% over the past 12 months"
- "Current inventory levels are X months of supply, up from Y months a year ago, indicating a softening market"
- "Average days on market in [area] is now X days, up from Y days, indicating reduced demand"

### What We Should Build
- **Automated market conditions section** in protest packets that pulls:
  - Current vs. prior year median prices from TRERC
  - Mortgage rate comparison (from FRED API — free)
  - Inventory and days-on-market trends
- This requires NO individual sales data — just aggregate statistics
- Can be generated programmatically from free public data sources

## 6. Alternative Market Value Approaches

### The Cost Approach

**Formula:** Land Value + Replacement Cost New (RCN) − Depreciation = Value

Per the Texas Comptroller: "The cost approach bases value on what it would cost to replace the building (improvement) with one of equal utility. Appraisal districts apply depreciation and add the estimate to the land value."

### When It's Useful
- Per O'Connor: "The cost approach is not typically used at property tax protest hearings except for new buildings"
- CADs use it internally for properties up to 2-3 years old
- **Best case:** If land + construction cost < CAD's appraised value, this is strong evidence
- **Less useful for older homes** because depreciation calculations are subjective and hard to defend

### Depreciation Rates for Residential in TX
- CADs typically use **1-2% per year** of physical depreciation for well-maintained homes
- A 20-year-old home might have 20-30% total depreciation applied
- "Effective age" (based on condition) may differ from actual age
- Deferred maintenance, functional obsolescence, and external obsolescence can add more depreciation

### Can We Calculate This from Our Data?
- **Land value:** Available from CAD records (they break out land vs. improvement value)
- **Replacement cost:** Harder — requires cost-per-sqft data (Marshall & Swift, RSMeans, or CAD's own schedules)
- **Depreciation:** We'd need to estimate based on age and condition
- **Verdict: Possible but complex. Lower priority than other approaches.**

### Is the Cost Approach Accepted at ARB?
- Yes, it's one of the three recognized appraisal methods
- ARB panels understand it
- Most effective for newer construction or when replacement cost clearly shows overvaluation
- Less persuasive for 20+ year old homes (too many subjective depreciation arguments)

### Property Condition Evidence (Complementary to Cost Approach)
- Photos of deferred maintenance, damage, outdated features
- Repair estimates or contractor quotes
- Foundation issues, roof damage, water damage
- Any factor that reduces market value below what a "typical" home in the neighborhood would sell for
- **This is evidence any homeowner can provide without sales data**

---

## 7. Hybrid Argument Strategy

### The Dual-Argument Powerhouse

**Primary: Equity/Uniformity (§42.26)**
- This is our existing strength — precomputed comparable properties and adjusted $/sqft
- "My property is assessed higher per square foot than similar properties in my area"
- Does NOT require sales data — only appraised values of comparable properties (public data)

**Secondary: Market Value (§23.01)**
- "Additionally, the CAD's appraised value exceeds the actual market value of my property"
- Supported by: recent purchase price, CAD's own sales comps (from evidence packet), market condition data, cost approach, or property condition evidence

### How to Frame the Dual Argument
> "I am protesting on the grounds of BOTH incorrect appraised (market) value AND unequal appraisal. 
>
> **First**, my property is unequally appraised compared to similar properties. [Present equity evidence — our existing strength]
>
> **Second**, the appraised value exceeds market value. [Present one or more of: purchase price, market conditions, CAD's own sales comps, condition issues]
>
> Under either measure, my property's appraised value should be reduced to $[target value]."

### Does Presenting Both Make Each Argument Stronger?
**Yes, for several reasons:**
1. **Two independent paths to reduction** — if the ARB is skeptical of one, they may accept the other
2. **Reinforcing narrative** — "overvalued by BOTH measures" is more compelling than either alone
3. **Preserves appeal rights** — checking both boxes on Form 50-132 preserves options for binding arbitration or district court
4. **Professional firms do it** — SquareDeal.tax notes that "most property tax protest companies take recourse to mass protests based on market value AND unequal appraisal"
5. **Covers different scenarios** — equity works when neighbors are assessed lower; market value works when the whole neighborhood is overassessed

### Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1 (Now):** Add market value argument via market conditions data + recent purchase prompt + guidance on CAD evidence packet → NO new data needed
- **Phase 2 (Next):** Build automated CAD evidence analysis tools → requires customer to upload their packet
- **Phase 3 (Future):** License sales data to generate our own market value comps → requires revenue/funding

## 8. What to Tell Customers Without Sales Data

### For ALL Customers (Default Guidance)

**1. Request the CAD's Evidence Packet**
- "After filing your protest, send a written request under §41.461 for all evidence the CAD plans to present"
- "The CAD must provide this at least 14 days before your hearing — it often includes their sales comps"
- "Use our guide to analyze their comps and find weaknesses"

**2. Check for Market Condition Arguments**
- We can auto-generate this section based on county-level data
- Include TRERC stats, mortgage rate impact, inventory/days-on-market trends
- "The overall market in your area has [declined/flattened], which supports a lower valuation"

**3. Document Property Condition Issues**
- "Take photos of any deferred maintenance, damage, or outdated features"
- "Get repair estimates if possible"
- "These reduce your home's market value below what a 'typical' property would sell for"

### For Customers Who Purchased Recently
- "Your recent purchase is the strongest market value evidence available"
- "Include your closing disclosure showing the purchase price"
- "If your purchase price was below the CAD's appraised value, this alone can win your case"

### For Customers Who DIDN'T Purchase Recently

**Should we tell them to check Zillow/Redfin?**

This is nuanced:
- **Zillow Zestimates** in Texas are **especially inaccurate** because they rely on tax values (circular logic)
- **Sold prices** are generally NOT shown for Texas properties on Zillow/Redfin
- However, some sites may show **listing prices** and **price history** (list price changes, days on market)
- HomeTaxShield warns: "Relying on these websites for protest evidence will undermine your case"

**Our recommendation:**
- **DO NOT** tell customers to use Zestimates as evidence
- **DO** tell customers: "If you know of recent sales in your neighborhood (from neighbors, your realtor, etc.), this information can support your case"
- **DO** tell customers: "Ask a local realtor for recent comparable sales — many will provide 3-5 comps for free"
- **DO** tell customers: "Check listing prices on Zillow/Redfin to understand market trends (not as direct evidence, but to inform your opinion of value)"

### Template Customer Guidance

```
📋 STRENGTHENING YOUR PROTEST WITH MARKET VALUE EVIDENCE

Your protest packet already includes an equity/uniformity argument showing 
your property is assessed higher than similar properties. Here's how to 
make your case even stronger:

1. REQUEST THE CAD'S EVIDENCE (Most Important!)
   After filing your protest, send a written request to the CAD under 
   Tax Code §41.461 for all evidence they plan to present. They MUST 
   provide it at least 14 days before your hearing. Their evidence 
   often contains sales comparables you can use in YOUR argument.

2. IF YOU PURCHASED RECENTLY (within 3 years):
   Include your Closing Disclosure showing the purchase price. If you 
   paid less than the CAD's appraised value, this is powerful evidence.

3. DOCUMENT CONDITION ISSUES:
   Take photos of any maintenance issues, damage, or needed repairs. 
   Get contractor estimates if possible. These reduce market value.

4. ASK A REALTOR FOR COMPS:
   Most local realtors will provide 3-5 recent sales comparables for 
   free. This gives you actual market data to present.

5. MARKET CONDITIONS:
   [Auto-generated section based on county data — see Section 5]

## 9. Cook County (IL) — Different Story

### Illinois IS a Disclosure State
- Sale prices **ARE** public record in Illinois
- Recorded on the Real Estate Transfer Declaration (PTAX-203) filed with every sale
- The Cook County Assessor's Office publishes sales data openly

### Public Sales Data Sources for Cook County

**1. Cook County Assessor Open Data Portal**
- **Parcel Sales dataset:** https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Parcel-Sales/wvhk-k5uv
- Contains **parcel sales for real property from 1999 to present**
- Includes sale price, sale date, property characteristics
- Used by the Assessor's own CAMA (Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal) system
- **Downloadable as CSV** and **accessible via API** (Socrata/SODA API)
- This is the SAME data the Assessor uses to value properties

**2. Cook County Assessor GitHub (ccao-data)**
- Open-source valuation models: https://github.com/ccao-data
- Includes the actual model code used to assess residential properties
- `model-res-avm` for single-family; `model-condo-avm` for condos
- `ptaxsim` — R package to estimate counterfactual property tax bills

**3. Cook Viewer (Interactive Map)**
- https://maps.cookcountyil.gov/cookviewer/
- The Assessor's recommended tool for finding comparable properties
- Shows property characteristics, values, and neighborhood codes

### Cook County Appeal Process
- **Two levels:** Assessor's Office → Board of Review (BOR)
- **Three common grounds:**
  1. **Uniformity** — assessed higher per sqft than similar properties
  2. **Recent Purchase** — bought within 3 years for less than market value estimate (use closing docs)
  3. **Market/Overvaluation** — similar homes sold for less within last 3 years

### PTAX Forms
- **PTAX-203 (Real Estate Transfer Declaration):** Filed with every sale, contains sale price — this IS how sales become public
- **Appeal forms** are filed online through the Assessor's website or BOR

### What We Can Do for Cook County
- **YES — we can and should incorporate sales comps into Cook County packets!**
- The data is free, public, and downloadable
- We can pull from the Assessor's Parcel Sales dataset
- Find sales within same neighborhood code, similar sqft/age/class
- Calculate adjusted $/sqft and present as market value evidence
- This is a **significant competitive advantage** — most DIY homeowners don't know this data exists or how to use it

### Cook County Action Items
1. Download and index the Parcel Sales dataset
2. Build a comp-matching algorithm (same neighborhood code, similar characteristics)
3. Auto-generate a sales comp grid for each property
4. Include in the protest packet alongside equity comps
5. Add a "Recent Purchase" prompt for IL customers too

## 10. Building a Sales Comp Feature

### For Texas — Data Licensing Options

| Source | Cost Estimate | Coverage | Notes |
|--------|--------------|----------|-------|
| ATTOM Property Navigator | $499/year | Nationwide | 200 reports/mo — may be enough for spot-checking |
| ATTOM API | ~$500-1,000/month | Nationwide | Per-call pricing, need sales + property data |
| Realie.ai | Lower cost | Nationwide | "Same data as ATTOM but cheaper" per Reddit |
| BatchData | Varies | Nationwide | Per-record pricing |
| Homesage.ai | ~$100/month | Nationwide | Good for scaling small companies |
| CoreLogic | $1,000s/month | Nationwide | Enterprise-level, likely overkill |

### Scraping Zillow/Redfin — Legal Issues
- **Zillow/Redfin don't show sold prices in TX** — there's nothing to scrape
- Even in disclosure states, scraping violates their Terms of Service
- Zillow has sued companies for scraping (e.g., VHT Studios lawsuit)
- **Verdict: Do not scrape. Use licensed data or public records.**

### County Clerk Deed/Mortgage Filings as Proxy
- **Deed of Trust amounts** are public record and could serve as price floor estimates
- Would require county-by-county data scraping/purchasing
- Accuracy is limited (doesn't capture cash sales, refinances muddy data, down payment varies)
- **Verdict: Interesting research project but not reliable enough for formal evidence**

### Is This Worth Doing?
**For Texas:**
- Equity-only argument is ALREADY strong and gets reductions
- Market value adds incremental value but requires expensive data
- **Phase 1:** Market conditions + purchase price + CAD evidence analysis = 80% of the benefit for ~0% of the data cost
- **Phase 2:** When we have revenue, license ATTOM or Homesage.ai for spot-check comp verification
- **Phase 3:** Full sales comp automation if we can justify the ROI

**For Cook County:**
- **Absolutely yes** — the data is FREE and public
- This should be Phase 1 for IL
- Massive competitive advantage over other DIY tools

---

## 11. Recommendations & Action Items

### Immediate (Phase 1) — No New Data Needed

1. **✅ Add "Market Value" checkbox to protest filings**

   - This preserves maximum rights with zero extra work

2. **✅ Build §41.461 evidence request template**
   - Auto-generate a letter customers can send with their protest filing
   - Include guidance on when/how to submit it
   - This unlocks the CAD's sales comps for the customer

3. **✅ Build CAD evidence analysis guide**
   - How to read the evidence packet
   - What to look for (stale comps, cherry-picking, inconsistent adjustments)
   - Template arguments to use at the hearing
   - Worksheet for calculating sale ratios

4. **✅ Add "Recent Purchase" prompt to customer intake**
   - "Did you buy this property in the last 3 years?"
   - If yes, collect purchase price and closing date
   - Auto-generate market value argument from purchase data
   - Template: "Property purchased for $X on [date], which is $Y below CAD's appraised value"

5. **✅ Auto-generate market conditions section**
   - Pull TRERC data for county-level trends (median prices, inventory, DOM)
   - Include mortgage rate comparison from FRED API (free)
   - Frame the narrative: "Market conditions in [county] support a value at or below $X"

6. **✅ Add property condition guidance**
   - Prompt customers to upload photos of deferred maintenance
   - Suggest they get repair estimates
   - Include condition factors in market value argument

7. **✅ Cook County: Incorporate public sales comps**
   - Download Assessor's Parcel Sales dataset
   - Build comp-matching algorithm
   - Auto-generate sales comp grid for IL protest packets

### Near-Term (Phase 2) — Customer-Assisted Data

8. **📋 CAD evidence packet upload feature**
   - Let customers upload their §41.461 evidence packet (PDF)
   - Parse/OCR the sales comps grid
   - Auto-analyze for weaknesses (stale comps, inconsistent adjustments, cherry-picking)
   - Generate rebuttal arguments

9. **📋 Realtor comp integration**
   - Partner with a realtor (or get a license) for MLS comp pulls
   - Could offer as a premium feature
   - Even 3-5 MLS comps per property would be valuable

### Future (Phase 3) — Licensed Data

10. **🔮 License sales data from ATTOM or alternative**
    - Start with Homesage.ai (~$100/month) or ATTOM Navigator ($499/year) for spot-checks
    - Scale to API access when volume justifies it
    - Full automation of market value comp grids

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Filing both equity AND market value is already best practice** — we should do this for every customer now
2. **The CAD's own evidence packet (§41.461) is our secret weapon** — it gives customers free access to sales data they can't get anywhere else
3. **Recent purchase price is the strongest market value evidence** — we should ask every customer about this
4. **Market conditions data is free and powerful** — TRERC, FRED, and aggregate statistics require no sales data
5. **Cook County is a goldmine** — free public sales data means we can build full comp-based packets today
6. **We don't need MLS access to build a strong market value argument** — Phase 1 gets us 80% of the way there for $0
