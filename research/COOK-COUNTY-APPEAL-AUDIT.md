# Cook County Property Tax Appeal Package Audit
## Comprehensive Research Report for Overtaxed ($49 Appeal/Evidence Packages)

**Date:** February 17, 2026  
**Market:** Cook County, IL (~971K properties in database)  
**Product:** $49 pre-built appeal/evidence packages for homeowners

---

## Executive Summary

Cook County has the **most complex property tax assessment system in the United States**, and it's also one of the most appeal-friendly. Key findings:

1. **The market is enormous and underserved.** Cook County has 1.8M+ parcels. Only ~27% of homeowners appeal their taxes annually vs. 64% for commercial. There's a massive untapped residential market.

2. **Success rates are remarkably high.** ~56% of all appeals filed see a reduction. Professional firms claim 77-90% success rates. The BOR has historically granted relief in ~62% of cases.

3. **The two-bite system is unique.** Cook County homeowners can appeal TWICE per year — first to the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO), then to the Cook County Board of Review (CCBOR). Each is independent. Reductions are cumulative.

4. **Residential appeals are simpler than commercial.** Class 2 residential appeals don't require a brief, income data, or a Historical Summary Form. The bar for homeowners is intentionally low.

5. **Our $49 package is competitively positioned but needs to deliver professional-grade evidence.** Competitors charge 25-50% of savings (contingency) or flat fees of $300+. Our flat-fee model is dramatically cheaper. The key is providing evidence that matches what professional firms compile.

6. **Comparable properties are EVERYTHING.** Both the CCAO and CCBOR evaluate appeals primarily on comparable property analysis — either uniformity (assessed value comparisons) or market value (sales comparisons).

## Part 1: Cook County Board of Review (CCBOR) Process — Deep Dive

### 1.1 What the CCBOR Evaluates

The CCBOR is a **separate, quasi-judicial agency independent of the Assessor**. After the Assessor completes township reassessments, property owners may appeal to the BOR. The BOR's decision sets the **final county valuation** for that tax year.

The BOR evaluates:
- **Uniformity of assessment** — Is the property assessed higher per square foot than comparable properties?
- **Market value / overvaluation** — Is the assessed market value higher than actual market value based on recent sales?
- **Factual errors** — Incorrect square footage, wrong number of rooms, incorrect classification
- **Recent purchase price** — If purchased within 3 years in an arm's-length transaction for less than assessed value
- **Special circumstances** — Fire, flood, demolition, vacancy

**Critical insight: The BOR is NOT bound by the Assessor's final determination.** You can appeal to the BOR regardless of whether the Assessor granted or denied your appeal. You are at no disadvantage.

### 1.2 Filing Requirements & Forms

#### For Residential (Class 2) Appeals:
- **Official Complaint Form** — Must use the BOR's prescribed form (available for download or online filing). No reproductions accepted.
- **Online filing** — Available at https://appeals.cookcountyboardofreview.com/
- **Duplicate filing** — Paper forms must be filed in duplicate; online filing doesn't require duplicates
- **Separate complaints** — One per property/PIN (multiple related PINs can be on one form)
- **Signature required** — By taxpayer or attorney
- **Fax filing NOT permitted**

#### What's NOT Required for Residential (Class 2):
- No brief or letter required (only for non-Class 2)
- No Historical Summary Form required (only for non-Class 2)
- No copies of prior Assessor appeal documents required
- No income/expense data (unless it's a rental property appeal)

#### What IS Required/Recommended:
- **Photos of subject property** — Required if purchased within 3 years (Rule 18), strongly encouraged for all appeals. Date should be marked on reverse.
- **Photos of comparable properties** — "Strongly encouraged"
- **Comparable property PINs** — To identify comparison properties
- **Comparable property data** — Assessed values, square footage, characteristics
- **Recent closing documents** — If purchased within 3 years
- **Appraisals** — If submitted, must include original photo and PINs of all properties in analysis (Rule 19)

### 1.3 Online Filing System

The BOR's online system (https://appeals.cookcountyboardofreview.com/) supports:
- **Pre-registration** — Available before township opens; ensures timely filing
- **Full online complaint filing** — Including document uploads
- **Evidence submission** — Can be submitted up to 5 days prior to hearing through the portal
- **Status tracking** — View current year appeal status and 5-year decision history

### 1.4 Residential vs. Commercial Appeals

| Feature | Residential (Class 2) | Commercial (Class 5) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Assessment Level | 10% of FMV | 25% of FMV |
| Self-representation | Yes (pro se allowed) | Must use attorney (if entity) |
| Brief/letter required | No | Yes |
| Historical Summary Form | No | Yes |
| Income data required | No (unless rental) | Yes (Rule 20) |
| Color photo required | Encouraged | Required (within 12 months) |
| Evidence complexity | Low | High |
| Success rate | ~56% overall | Higher (better resourced) |

### 1.5 Appeal Deadlines & Triennial Cycle

Cook County follows a **triennial reassessment cycle** across 38 townships in 3 groups:

| Group | Area | Last Reassessed | Next Reassessment |
|-------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| City of Chicago | Chicago proper | 2024 | 2027 |
| North/NW Suburbs | North Cook County | 2023 (reassessing 2025*) | 2026 |
| South/SW Suburbs | South Cook County | 2022 | 2025 |

*Note: As of 2025, north suburbs were being reassessed.*

**Key timing facts:**
- Each township opens for a **minimum of 30 days** for appeals
- Opening/closing dates are published by the BOR but vary annually and are NOT set in advance
- The date of a U.S. Postal Service postmark counts as the filing date
- **You can appeal EVERY YEAR**, not just in reassessment years
- Pre-registration is available year-round through the online portal
- Filing after deadline = must wait until next year

**Recent unprecedented event (late 2025):** The BOR reopened 24 previously closed townships for appeals (Dec 3-12, 2025) due to record-setting 16.7% median tax increases and delayed billing. This signals the political sensitivity of the issue.

### 1.6 Two-Level Appeal System (CCAO → CCBOR)

This is **unique to Cook County** and crucial for our product:

1. **First Appeal: Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO)**
   - Filed via SmartFile (online system)
   - Typically 30 days from reassessment notice
   - CCAO analysts also find their own comps
   - Decisions come 100-125 days after filing
   - No attorney required even for LLCs

2. **Second Appeal: Cook County Board of Review (CCBOR)**
   - Filed after CCAO decision (or independently)
   - Independent review — not bound by CCAO decision
   - Township-specific filing windows
   - Option to request oral hearing (telephonic for pro se)
   - Results in 3-6 months

**Both appeals are cumulative** — reductions from both stack. Professional firms file at BOTH levels.

### 1.7 Post-BOR Options

If still unsatisfied after BOR:
- **Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB)** — State-level appeal, filed within 30 days of BOR decision
- **Cook County Circuit Court** — Tax objection complaint (judicial review)

## Part 2: What Wins Appeals

### 2.1 The Three Main Arguments

#### A. Uniformity (Lack of Uniformity) — **MOST COMMON FOR RESIDENTIAL**

The Illinois Constitution requires taxes on real property to be "levied uniformly by valuation." This is the **primary argument** for residential appeals.

**How it works:**
- Compare your property's assessed value PER SQUARE FOOT to comparable properties
- Formula: `Building Assessment ÷ Building Square Footage = Assessment per SqFt`
- If your property's assessment/sqft is higher than comparable properties, you have a uniformity argument

**What makes a good comparable for uniformity:**
1. Same township and neighborhood code
2. Same or similar property class code
3. Similar age
4. Similar building square footage
5. Similar land square footage
6. Similar construction type (frame vs. masonry)
7. Same general location

**CCAO Rule 15 specifies the seven most important factors for choosing residential comps:**
1. Neighborhood (same neighborhood code)
2. Class code
3. Building square footage (similar size)
4. Age (similar age)
5. Land square footage (similar lot size)
6. Construction type
7. Location within neighborhood

**Minimum 3 comparable properties required** (per CCAO rules). BOR recommends 3-5.

**Critical: Do NOT "cherry pick" only lower-valued comps.** The CCAO explicitly warns against this. Select the most truly comparable properties.

#### B. Market Value (Overvaluation) — **STRONG WITH SALES DATA**

Argue the Assessor's estimated market value exceeds actual market value.

**Evidence needed:**
- Recent sale prices of comparable properties (within 3 years)
- Your own recent purchase price (if within 3 years, arm's-length)
- Professional appraisal (must be USPAP-compliant)

**Why it's powerful:**
- Uses the assessor's own methodology against them
- Cook County values are "notoriously unreliable" per practitioners
- Recent sales are hard to argue against

#### C. Economic Value / Income Approach — **FOR RENTAL PROPERTIES ONLY**

Based on net income the property generates. Requires 3 years of income/expense data (Schedule E, IRS 1040). **Not relevant for owner-occupied single-family homes.**

### 2.2 Property Characteristics vs. Pure Value Comparisons

Both matter, but **property characteristics determine which comps are valid**:

- **Square footage** — Single most important matching criterion
- **Age** — Must be within similar range
- **Class code** — Must match (a 2-03 shouldn't be compared to a 2-07)
- **Beds/baths** — Important but secondary to sqft and age
- **Construction type** — Frame vs. masonry changes valuation significantly
- **Lot size** — Affects land assessment component
- **Condition** — Photos document this; major deficiencies warrant adjustment

**The CCAO assessor has told homeowners:** "If the property characteristics on this notice are correct and the estimated market value is within 10 percent of what you think your home is worth, then it is unlikely that an appeal would change your property's assessed value enough to significantly affect its property tax bill."

**Implication for Overtaxed:** We need accurate characteristics data AND good comp matching to identify properties where an appeal is likely to succeed.

### 2.3 Photos and Appraisals

**Photos:**
- Required for properties purchased within 3 years (BOR Rule 18)
- Required for non-residential (color photo of front, within 12 months)
- "Strongly encouraged" for all residential appeals and comparable properties
- Date should be clearly marked
- Both subject property AND comparable properties

**Appraisals:**
- Must be USPAP-compliant
- Must include photo and PIN of subject and all comps used
- Any appraisal within 2 years prior to lien date (Jan 1) must be disclosed (CCAO Rule 14)
- Powerful but expensive ($300-500+ for residential)

**Our product implication:** We should recommend customers take and attach a photo of their property. We should NOT promise to provide appraisals at $49.

### 2.4 Common Mistakes That Get Appeals Denied

Based on attorney guides and official sources:

1. **Missing the deadline** — #1 killer. Townships close on hard dates.
2. **Using non-comparable properties** — Comparing a 1,100 sqft frame home to a 2,500 sqft brick home
3. **Cherry-picking only low-value comps** — CCAO explicitly warns against this
4. **Arguing tax amount or tax rate** — Appeals are about ASSESSED VALUE, not tax bills or rates
5. **Arguing taxes increased too much** — Not a legally valid argument
6. **Submitting excessive/irrelevant documents** — Constitutional arguments, emotional pleas, etc.
7. **Not checking property record card first** — If the Assessor has UNDERESTIMATED features (e.g., missed your finished basement), filing may TRIGGER a reassessment that increases your taxes
8. **Comparing neighbor's tax BILLS instead of assessed values** — Tax bills include exemptions that may not apply to you
9. **Not filing at BOTH levels** (CCAO and BOR) — Leaving money on the table
10. **Purchasing above assessed value and appealing** — If you bought for more than the assessed market value, an appeal could RAISE your assessment

## Part 3: Legal Framework

### 3.1 Key Statutes

- **35 ILCS 200/9-5** — Authorizes BOR to establish rules for orderly dispatch of business
- **35 ILCS 200/16-105** — Prescribes official complaint forms for assessment appeals
- **35 ILCS 200/16-70** — BOR jurisdiction over exemption determinations
- **35 ILCS 200/16-185** — Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB) procedures
- **Illinois Constitution, Art. IX, §4** — Uniformity requirement: "taxes upon real property shall be levied uniformly by valuation"

### 3.2 Cook County Equalization Factor (State Multiplier)

This is critical context for understanding Cook County assessments:

- Illinois law requires that the **aggregate assessed value** of all property in each county equals **33⅓% of fair market value**
- Cook County assesses residential at **10%** of FMV (via county ordinance)
- To bring the county's aggregate to 33⅓%, the Illinois Department of Revenue applies an **equalization factor (multiplier)**
- **2024 Final Equalization Factor: 3.0355** (tentative was 2.8487)
- This multiplier is applied AFTER the BOR sets final values

**How it works in practice:**
```
Assessed Value (AV) = 10% × Assessor's Market Value
Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) = AV × State Equalization Factor
Property Tax = EAV × Local Tax Rate
```

Example:
- Assessor's Market Value: $300,000
- Assessed Value: $30,000 (10%)
- EAV: $30,000 × 3.0355 = $91,065
- Tax Rate: 7.5%
- Tax Bill: $91,065 × 0.075 = $6,830

**For appeals:** Reducing the Assessed Value reduces EAV proportionally. The equalization factor amplifies any reduction.

### 3.3 Assessment Level Details

Cook County classification system (unique in Illinois):

| Class | Description | Assessment Level |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Vacant Land | 10% |
| 2 | Residential (≤6 units, <20K sqft) | 10% |
| 3 | Apartment Buildings (7+ units) | 10% |
| 4 | Not-for-Profit | 25% |
| 5a | Commercial | 25% |
| 5b | Industrial | 25% |
| Various | Incentive classes | 10-25% |

**Residential subclasses (Class 2) — IMPORTANT for comp matching:**
- 2-02: One-story, any age, up to 999 sqft
- 2-03: One-story, any age, 1,000-1,800 sqft
- 2-04: One-story, any age, 1,801+ sqft
- 2-05: Two+ story, over 62 years old, up to 2,200 sqft
- 2-06: Two+ story, over 62 years old, 2,201+ sqft
- 2-07: Two+ story, 0-62 years old, up to 2,200 sqft
- 2-08: Two+ story, 0-62 years old, 2,201+ sqft
- 2-09: Two+ story, frame, any age, up to 999 sqft
- 2-10: Town/row house
- 2-11: Mixed-use (residential with commercial, ≤6 units total)
- 2-12: Mixed-use (residential with commercial, 2-6 units, per 2025 rule updates)

### 3.4 Uniformity vs. Market Value Appeals

| Aspect | Uniformity | Market Value |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| What you compare | Assessed values of comparable properties | Sale prices of comparable properties |
| Evidence needed | PINs, assessed values, characteristics | Recent sales data (within 3 years) |
| Best when | Your assessment/sqft is higher than similar properties | Assessor's market value exceeds actual market |
| Reduction duration | Typically lasts through triennial cycle | May be more limited in duration |
| Complexity | Moderate — need good comp matching | Moderate — need actual sales data |
| Data availability | Public (assessor records) | Requires MLS or deed records |

**Professional consensus:** Most successful residential appeals in Cook County use **uniformity** arguments, often combined with market value evidence when available. The uniformity approach is more accessible because all the data (assessed values, characteristics) is publicly available through the Assessor's website and Cook Viewer.

## Part 5: Gap Analysis for Our $49 Product

### 5.1 What We Currently Have
- Address, PIN, square footage, beds, baths, year built
- Assessed value, market value
- Comparable properties (comps)

### 5.2 What We're Missing / Need to Strengthen

#### Critical Gaps:

1. **Property Class Code** — Essential for comp matching. Must match when selecting comps. This is the single most important data field we may be missing.

2. **Neighborhood Code** — Cook County assigns neighborhood codes that constrain valid comps. Comps should ideally be in the same neighborhood code.

3. **Construction Type** — Frame vs. masonry vs. stucco. Affects valuation and comp comparability.

4. **Land Square Footage (Lot Size)** — One of the 7 key comp factors per CCAO. 

5. **Assessment Per Square Foot** — The KEY metric for uniformity arguments. We need to calculate and present: `Building Assessment ÷ Building SqFt = $/SqFt` for both subject and comps.

6. **Recent Sale Prices for Comps** — For market value arguments. Need MLS data or deed records showing actual sale prices within 3 years.

7. **Township Identification** — Critical for knowing which filing windows apply.

8. **Current Year Equalization Factor** — Needed to calculate actual tax impact of any reduction.

9. **Local Tax Rate** — Needed to estimate dollar savings.

10. **Exemption Status** — Homeowner exemption, senior exemption, etc. Affects actual tax bill and savings estimate.

#### Desirable Additions:

11. **Cook Viewer Integration or Reference** — The CCAO's recommended tool for finding comps. We should at minimum reference it.

12. **Filing Calendar Integration** — Township-specific opening/closing dates.

13. **Prior Appeal History** — Has this property been appealed before? What was the result? (Available via BOR's 5-year decision history)

14. **Assessment Trend** — How has the assessed value changed over the triennial cycle?

15. **Photo Guidance** — Instructions for customer to photograph their property.

### 5.3 Product Strengths

- **$49 flat fee is dramatically cheaper** than ANY competitor:
  - Contingency firms: typically $250-2,500+ per appeal
  - Flat-fee attorneys: $300+
  - Ownwell: 25-35% of savings
- **Pre-built evidence package saves significant time** — The main barrier to DIY appeal is research
- **No risk to customer** — Filing an appeal in IL cannot increase your assessment
- **Can serve as "evidence prep" for both CCAO and BOR levels**

### 5.4 Product Weaknesses / Risks

- **We don't file the appeal** — Customer must self-file. May need clear instructions.
- **We don't attend hearings** — Customer is on their own at BOR (but hearings are optional for residential)
- **We can't represent entities** — LLCs, corporations, condo associations need attorneys at BOR
- **Quality of comps is the make-or-break factor** — If our comp selection is poor, the appeal fails
- **We need to be careful about "unauthorized practice of law"** — We're selling evidence packages, not legal advice

---

## Part 6: Specific Recommendations

### 6.1 Evidence Package Contents (What Our $49 Package Should Include)

**For each property, the Overtaxed appeal package should contain:**

1. **Cover Sheet / Summary**
   - Property address, PIN, township
   - Current assessed value, market value, assessment per sqft
   - Recommended appeal type (uniformity and/or market value)
   - Estimated potential reduction range
   - Estimated annual tax savings (using current eq. factor and tax rate)

2. **Subject Property Profile**
   - All characteristics: class code, sqft, lot size, beds, baths, year built, construction type
   - Current assessed value breakdown (land + building)
   - Assessment per square foot
   - Assessment history (3-5 years if available)
   - Map showing property location

3. **Comparable Properties Analysis (3-5 comps)**
   - For each comp: PIN, address, class code, sqft, lot size, age, beds, baths, construction type
   - Assessed value, assessment per sqft
   - Distance from subject property
   - For sales comps: sale price, sale date, implied market value per sqft
   - How each comp compares to subject on key characteristics

4. **Comparison Summary Table**
   - Side-by-side of subject vs. all comps
   - Highlighting the assessment disparity ($/sqft or market value gap)
   - Average comp assessment per sqft vs. subject

5. **Filing Instructions Guide**
   - Step-by-step for CCAO SmartFile filing
   - Step-by-step for BOR online filing
   - Township-specific deadline reminder
   - What to upload and where
   - Tips for requesting vs. waiving hearing

6. **Photo Instructions**
   - How to take a compliant exterior photo of subject property
   - Optional: how to photograph comparable properties
   - Date marking requirements

7. **Appeal Narrative Template** (Optional but Valuable)
   - Pre-written template stating the uniformity/market value argument
   - Customized with the specific numbers from the analysis
   - While not required for Class 2, it helps make the case clearer

### 6.2 Data Improvements Needed

**Priority 1 (Must Have):**
- Property class code (2-02 through 2-12)
- Neighborhood code
- Construction type (frame/masonry/other)
- Land square footage
- Township identification
- Assessment per square foot (calculated)

**Priority 2 (Should Have):**
- Recent sale prices for comparable properties (MLS data)
- Current equalization factor
- Local tax rate for the property's tax code area
- Prior BOR appeal history

**Priority 3 (Nice to Have):**
- Township filing calendar with open/close dates
- Exemption information
- Assessment trend over triennial cycle
- Cook Viewer deep-link for the property

### 6.3 Comp Selection Algorithm Requirements

Our comp algorithm should:
1. **Filter by same neighborhood code** (not just proximity)
2. **Filter by same or adjacent class code** (e.g., 2-03 can compare to 2-03 or maybe 2-02/2-04)
3. **Rank by similarity** on: sqft (±20%), age (±15 years), lot size (±30%), construction type (same preferred)
4. **Prefer lower-assessed comps** but include some neutral comps to avoid cherry-picking appearance
5. **For sales comps**: filter to arm's-length transactions within 3 years
6. **Calculate assessment per sqft** for all candidates
7. **Select 3-5 best comps** that are genuinely comparable AND show favorable uniformity disparity

### 6.4 Product Positioning Strategy

**Our differentiation from competitors:**

| Feature | Overtaxed ($49) | Contingency Firms (25-50% of savings) | Attorneys ($300+ flat) |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Upfront cost | $49 | $0 | $300+ |
| Total cost (if $1K savings) | $49 | $250-500 | $300+ |
| Total cost (if $3K savings) | $49 | $750-1,500 | $300+ |
| Files the appeal | No (DIY) | Yes | Yes |
| Attends hearings | No | Yes | Yes |
| Evidence quality | Professional-grade | Professional | Professional |
| Annual auto-renewal | No (rebuy) | Often auto-enrolled | Varies |
| Risk if no savings | $49 lost | $0 | $300+ lost |

**Key messaging:**
- "Professional-grade evidence for a fraction of the cost"
- "Same data the $500+ firms use"  
- "Everything you need to file — just follow the instructions"
- "The average Cook County homeowner saves $1,000-3,000. Your package costs $49."

### 6.5 Market Timing Recommendations

**For South/SW Suburbs (2025 reassessment year):**
- **This is the highest-opportunity market RIGHT NOW**
- Reassessment years produce the biggest jumps in assessed value
- BOR reopened townships in late 2025 due to record tax increases
- Homeowners are most motivated to appeal in reassessment years
- Savings from a successful reassessment-year appeal last 3 full years

**For City of Chicago (2024 reassessment, values effective through 2026):**
- Appeals for 2025 and 2026 (non-reassessment years) are still valuable
- Winning an appeal in Year 2 of the cycle produces ~2 years of savings
- Even Year 3 appeals are worth it (per Property Tax Solutions: even $800 in savings means $400 net after their fee)

**For North/NW Suburbs (reassessing 2025-2026):**
- Properties will be getting reassessment notices starting 2025
- This is prime appeal territory as new values are published

### 6.6 Legal/Compliance Considerations

1. **We are NOT practicing law** — We sell evidence/data packages. We don't advise, represent, or file.
2. **Non-attorneys cannot represent taxpayers before the BOR** — We should be clear that customers file themselves (pro se) or hire an attorney.
3. **Disclaimer needed:** "This evidence package provides data analysis to support your own property tax appeal. It does not constitute legal advice. Filing and representation are the responsibility of the property owner."
4. **LLCs and corporate-owned properties** MUST use an attorney at BOR — we should flag these and potentially offer an upsell or referral.
5. **Purchase price disclosure** — If customer bought within 3 years, they're required to disclose to BOR. We should remind them.

### 6.7 Future Upsell Opportunities

1. **"BOR Package" add-on ($29)** — After CCAO appeal, provide updated comp analysis using post-CCAO-reduction values of nearby properties
2. **Annual subscription ($39/year)** — Automatic new package each year when township opens
3. **Attorney referral** — Partner with Cook County attorneys for customers who want representation; earn referral fee
4. **Multi-property discount** — Property managers, investors with multiple PINs
5. **PTAB escalation guide** ($19) — If BOR appeal fails, guide for PTAB appeal

## Part 7: Market Context & Political Dynamics

### 7.1 The Tax Burden Shift Crisis

Cook County is experiencing a historic political crisis around property taxes:
- **2025 tax bills saw a record 16.7% median increase for homeowners**
- **$500M+ in tax burden shifted from commercial to residential** due to declining commercial property values (especially downtown office/retail)
- The BOR took the unprecedented step of reopening 24 townships for appeals
- South and West Side neighborhoods with minority homeowners were disproportionately affected
- Cook County Treasurer's research shows homeowners saw $2B added to tax bills over 3 years after "businesses found particular success appealing to the Board of Review"

**This is a massive market opportunity.** Homeowners are angry, confused, and motivated. The tools to appeal are free but complex. We simplify the evidence-gathering step.

### 7.2 Appeal Rate Disparity

- **Homeowners appeal 27% of the time** 
- **Commercial properties appeal 64% of the time**
- Commercial properties are more likely to use professional representation
- Result: commercial gets more reductions, shifting burden to residential

**Our thesis:** If we can increase the residential appeal rate by making evidence accessible and affordable, we help homeowners AND address a systemic inequality.

### 7.3 Assessor vs. BOR Tension

There's significant tension between the Cook County Assessor's Office (Fritz Kaegi) and the Board of Review:
- The Assessor has published data showing the BOR's appeal decisions shift tax burden FROM commercial TO residential
- The BOR counters that they're correcting inaccurate assessments
- This political dynamic means both agencies are responsive to public pressure about fairness
