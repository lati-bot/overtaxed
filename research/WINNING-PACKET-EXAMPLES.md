## 3. WHAT CAD EVIDENCE PACKETS LOOK LIKE

Per Square Deal's detailed blog analysis, a typical CAD evidence packet contains:

### Components:
1. **Property Record Card (PRC)** — Official record with living area, land size, year built, quality rating, condition, features, depreciation/effective age, bed/bath count
2. **Sales Comparables Grid** — Table of recent sales with: address, sale date, living area, lot size, sale price, $/sqft, adjustments for size/condition/features
3. **Equity Comparables Grid** — Similar properties and their appraised values per sqft (for "equal and uniform" argument)
4. **Adjustment Tables** — Internal formulas (e.g., $40/sqft for extra living area, $10K for a pool)
5. **Photos** — Street-view or aerial of subject and comps
6. **Maps** — Location of subject property and comps
7. **Neighborhood Match** — Which neighborhood code each comp belongs to
8. **Supporting Data** — MLS listings, building permits, market trend reports, appraiser notes

### Key Vulnerabilities in CAD Evidence:
- **Stale comps** — CAD builds grids using preliminary values. As protest season progresses, many comps get reduced after their own protests. CAD doesn't update grids → they use inflated numbers
- **Cherry-picked high-value sales** — CAD often skips lower-valued homes
- **Incorrect property data** — Wrong sqft, bed/bath counts are common
- **Comps from wrong neighborhood** — Sometimes different zip codes!
- **Inconsistent adjustments** — Different $/sqft adjustments for similar differences
- **Sale ratio inconsistencies** — CAD overvalues some comps while keeping yours at/above 1.00

### How to Turn CAD Evidence Against Them:
- Calculate sale ratio for each CAD comp (appraised value ÷ sale price)
- Look up current (post-protest) values of their comps
- Highlight comps from different neighborhoods
- Show inconsistent adjustment amounts
- Point out comps with better condition/features than subject

---

## 4. WHAT ARB MEMBERS ARE TRAINED TO EXPECT

### ARB Training Sources:
- **Texas Comptroller ARB Training Manual** (96-308): `https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/property-tax/docs/96-308.pdf`
- **ARB New Member Training Presentation**: `https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/property-tax/docs/arb/2019-arb-presentation.pdf`
- **PTAD Learning Portal**: `https://ptad-lms.cpa.texas.gov/`
- **Model Hearing Procedures**: Published by Comptroller, adopted by each ARB

### What ARB Members Are Taught:
- Tax Code §5.041 requires 8 hours of training for new ARB members
- Training covers: Texas property tax law, real estate appraisal basics, hearing procedures
- Per O'Connor's analysis: "The content is good, but limited. In eight hours, Comptroller staff attempt to train new appraisal review board members regarding Texas property tax law, real estate appraisal and property tax hearing procedures."
- **Meaningful training comes from other experienced ARB members** as they begin hearing appeals

### What the Comptroller Tells Homeowners to Bring:
(From official Comptroller protests page)
- Property photographs (yours and comparables)
- Receipts or estimates for repairs
- Sales price documentation (listings, closing statements)
- Calculations of median level of appraisal (if protesting equal and uniform)
- Affidavits, if needed
- Newspaper articles
- Architectural drawings or blueprints
- Engineering reports
- Property surveys
- Deed records

### Hearing Format (per Texas A&M Real Estate Research Center):
1. Opening questions (basis of appeal: market, equity, or both)
2. Presentation of evidence
3. Appraisal district response
4. Board deliberation
5. Final decision issued by ARB chair
- **Entire hearing may be limited to 15 minutes**
- Owner may choose to present first or after CAD
- **Bring 4 copies** (one for CAD staff + one for each of 3 ARB panel members)

## 5. WHAT MAKES EVIDENCE CREDIBLE vs AMATEUR

### CREDIBLE Evidence Characteristics:
| Feature | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Official CAD data** (account numbers, legal descriptions, neighborhood codes) | Shows you speak their language |
| **Clean tables** with consistent columns | Easy to scan in 15-minute hearing |
| **Maps showing comp locations** | Visual proof comps are nearby |
| **Both equity AND market approaches** | Covers all angles |
| **Mathematical adjustments** for size/age/features | Shows analytical rigor |
| **Citation of Tax Code sections** (§42.26, §41.461) | Invokes legal standards, not opinions |
| **Pre-calculated median values** | Does the math for the ARB |
| **Current CAD appraised values** (not stale data) | Shows you checked recently |
| **Professional formatting** (headers, consistent fonts, numbered exhibits) | Signals preparation & credibility |
| **Organized presentation** (summary first, detail after) | Respects the ARB's time |

### AMATEUR Evidence Characteristics:
| Feature | Why It Fails |
|---------|-------------|
| Zillow/Redfin screenshots | NOT accepted by most ARBs — data is unverified |
| Zestimates as evidence | Algorithm-generated, not market-based |
| Handwritten notes | Looks unprepared |
| Walls of text without tables | ARB can't scan quickly in 15 minutes |
| Comps from wrong jurisdiction/neighborhood | Immediately dismissed |
| Emotional arguments ("I can't afford this!") | ARB can only consider property VALUE |
| Complaints about tax rates/bills | Not in ARB's jurisdiction |
| Personal financial hardship | Not legally relevant |
| No copies for ARB members | Procedural fail — they can't review your evidence |
| Photocopied newspaper articles about market decline | Too general, not property-specific |
| No opinion of value stated | You must tell them WHAT value you think is correct |

---

## 6. EVIDENCE THAT FAILS — WHAT NOT TO DO

### From HomeTaxShield (explicit warning):
> "Do NOT rely on popular real estate websites like Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com for comparable sales data. County appraisal districts do not accept these sources as valid evidence because they often contain inaccurate or unverified information."

### From Reddit r/personalfinance:
> "Don't bother using Zillow or Redfin since it's not accurate and will be used against your petition."

### From Texas A&M Real Estate Research Center:
> "Notice I did not say anything about your tax bill, the tax rates, or your ability to pay. That is because these factors are not relevant to this process. The assessor only sets your value; they have no say in the tax rates."

### Common Failures:
1. **Using only verbal arguments** without written documentation
2. **Showing up without copies** of evidence for ARB members
3. **Using comps that aren't really comparable** (wrong size, age, location)
4. **Not stating an opinion of value** — you MUST say what you think it should be worth
5. **Being confrontational** — ARBs are quasi-judicial bodies, treat like court
6. **Missing deadlines** — late protests generally forfeited
7. **Not requesting CAD evidence** beforehand — walking in blind
8. **Using outdated or stale comp data** when current values may have been reduced
9. **Presenting repair photos without cost estimates** — ARB needs dollar amounts
10. **Filing wrong protest reasons** — narrows what evidence you can present

---

## 7. OPTIMAL LENGTH & FORMAT

### What the Research Shows:
- **ARB hearings are typically 15 minutes or less** — evidence must be scannable
- **Bring 4 copies** (1 for CAD + 3 for ARB panel members)
- **Texas A&M advice:** "Be concise and focus on your opinion of value and your primary supporting documentation"
- **HomeBuyingInstitute:** "Be thorough but concise: Include enough detail to make your point, but don't overwhelm the appraiser or ARB with unnecessary paperwork"

### Optimal Evidence Packet Structure (synthesized from all sources):

**Page 1: Executive Summary (THE MONEY PAGE)**
- Subject property: address, account number, legal description
- Current CAD appraised value
- Your opinion of value
- Key reasons for reduction (2-3 bullet points)
- Requested reduction amount and estimated tax savings

**Page 2: Equity Comparable Analysis**
- Table with 5-10 comparable properties showing:
  - Account number, address
  - Living area (sqft), lot size
  - Year built, quality/grade/condition
  - CAD appraised value, $/sqft
  - Neighborhood code
- Calculated median $/sqft of comps
- Your property's $/sqft vs median

**Page 3: Market Sales Analysis**
- Table with 3-5 recent comparable sales:
  - Address, sale date, sale price
  - Living area, lot size
  - Sale price $/sqft
  - Adjustments for differences
  - Adjusted sale price
- Calculated median adjusted sale price

**Page 4: Neighborhood Map**
- Subject property marked
- All comps plotted with identifiers
- Scale/distance markers
- Neighborhood boundary if applicable

**Page 5+ (if applicable): Condition Evidence**
- Photos of damage/deferred maintenance
- Contractor repair estimates on letterhead
- Professional appraisal summary (if available)

### Total: 3-5 pages ideal, up to 8-10 for complex cases

The professional firms (Square Deal, Rainbolt, etc.) typically produce **3-6 page reports** — concise enough for a 15-minute hearing but comprehensive enough to be credible.

---

## 8. USPAP PROFESSIONAL APPRAISER REPORT STANDARDS

### Two Report Types Under USPAP:
1. **Appraisal Report** (Standard 2-2(a)) — comprehensive, includes all reasoning and data
2. **Restricted Appraisal Report** (Standard 2-2(b)) — concise, limited audience (client only)

### Key USPAP Principles We Can Mimic:
- **Certification** — signed statement of who prepared the analysis
- **Purpose and scope** — clearly state what you're trying to determine
- **Market area analysis** — describe the neighborhood and market conditions
- **Highest and best use** — typically residential for homes
- **Approaches to value** — Sales Comparison (comps), Cost, Income
- **Reconciliation** — how you arrived at your final opinion of value
- **Assumptions and limiting conditions** — what caveats apply

### For Tax Protest Evidence, Mimic:
- Clear header with property identification
- Statement of purpose ("To determine the market value of the subject property as of January 1, [year]")
- Use of the **Sales Comparison Approach** with adjustments
- Professional adjustment grid format
- Final reconciled value opinion
- Signature/certification line
- Date of analysis

**Note:** You don't need to be a licensed appraiser to present comparable sales evidence. But formatting your evidence LIKE a professional appraisal report adds enormous credibility.

## 9. LEGAL AID & CLINIC RESOURCES

### Organizations That Help:
1. **San Antonio Legal Services Association (SALSA)** — runs Property Tax Protest Workshops in each city council district, collaborating with City of San Antonio and Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid

   - Tax Protest University (free video course)
   - `https://www.chandlercrouch.com/tax-protest-university/`

### No County Publishes "Model Protest Evidence"
- Counties publish **hearing procedures** but not example evidence packets
- The Comptroller publishes guides on WHAT to bring, but not sample evidence
- **This is a gap we can fill** — no one provides a truly great, free evidence template

---

## 10. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE SUMMARY

| Firm | Model | Price | Evidence Format | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Square Deal** | DIY report | $20-40 | PDF: comps grid + map + highlights | Best data approach, CAD-native language | No full-service, no representation |
| **PropertyTaxReduction** | DIY report + full-service | $50-100 report | PDF: location + summary + comps + map | Licensed consultants, money-back | Limited county coverage |
| **O'Connor** | Full-service | Contingency % | Internal (not shown) | Largest firm, massive database | Black box, high % fee |
| **Home Tax Shield** | Full-service | Contingency % | Internal (not shown) | AI + licensed pros | No DIY option |
| **Ownwell** | Full-service | 25% of savings | Internal (not shown) | Tech-forward, low fee | No transparency on evidence |
| **Chandler Crouch** | Full-service FREE | $0 | Internal (not shown) | Free, massive scale | Tarrant County only |
| **NTPTS** | Full-service | Varies | Internal (not shown) | DFW coverage | Limited info available |
| **Overtaxed (Us)** | ? | ? | ? | ? | Doesn't exist yet |

### The Gap We Can Fill:
1. **No one provides a free, professional-grade evidence packet** that a homeowner can use at a hearing
2. **Square Deal is the closest** but charges $20-40 and is Texas-focused
3. **The template/format is well-established** — every firm does roughly the same thing
4. **The data is publicly available** (CAD websites) — the value-add is in aggregation, formatting, and intelligence
5. **No one provides AI-powered analysis of the CAD's evidence** against the homeowner (Square Deal offers basic version)
6. **No one combines multiple protest strategies** (equity + market + condition) into one intelligent packet
7. **No one auto-generates the talking points** — owners still need to know what to say

---

## 11. THE BLUEPRINT: WHAT OUR EVIDENCE PACKET SHOULD LOOK LIKE

Based on all research, here's what a world-class protest evidence packet looks like:

### Design Principles:
1. **Look like a professional appraisal report** — not a Zillow screenshot
2. **Use CAD-native terminology** — neighborhood codes, CDU ratings, construction grades
3. **Lead with the conclusion** — opinion of value on page 1
4. **Make it scannable in 2 minutes** — ARB members have 15 min total
5. **Include talking points** — tell the owner exactly what to say
6. **Cite the law** — §42.26(a)(3) for equity, §1.04(7) for market value definition
7. **Show maps** — visual credibility is powerful
8. **Do the math for them** — pre-calculated medians, adjustments, ratios
9. **Print-ready** — 4 copies needed, works in B&W
10. **Include instructions** — separate cover page telling owner how to use it

### Proposed Page Layout:

**Cover Page: Instructions for the Homeowner**
- How to use this evidence packet
- What to say at each stage of the hearing
- How many copies to bring (4)
- Deadline reminders

**Page 1: Property Tax Protest Evidence — Executive Summary**
- Property address, account number, legal description
- Tax year
- CAD noticed appraised value
- Homeowner's opinion of value
- Basis for protest: ☐ Market Value ☐ Unequal Appraisal ☐ Both
- Key finding: "Based on [X] comparable properties in [neighborhood], the subject property should be appraised at $[X], representing a reduction of $[X] ([X]%)"
- Estimated annual tax savings: $[X]

**Page 2: Subject Property Details**
- Property characteristics (from CAD records): sqft, lot size, year built, bed/bath, quality, condition, grade
- Photo (street view or aerial)
- CAD property record card comparison — highlight any errors found

**Page 3: Equity Comparable Analysis (Unequal Appraisal)**
- Table: 5-10 properties from same neighborhood
  - Columns: Acct#, Address, Living Area, Lot Size, Year Built, Quality, CDU, Appraised Value, $/sqft
- Median appraised $/sqft of comps
- Subject's appraised $/sqft
- Calculated "equal & uniform" value = Subject sqft × median $/sqft
- Citation: "Per Texas Property Tax Code §42.26(a)(3)"

**Page 4: Market Sales Analysis (Market Value)**
- Table: 3-5 recent comparable sales
  - Columns: Address, Sale Date, Sale Price, Living Area, Lot Size, Year Built, Sale $/sqft, Adjustments, Adjusted Price
- Median adjusted sale price
- Citation: "Per Texas Property Tax Code §1.04(7), 'market value' means the price for which a property would sell..."

**Page 5: Comparable Properties Map**
- Subject property marked with star
- Each comp numbered and plotted
- Distance circles (0.25 mi, 0.5 mi, 1 mi)
- Neighborhood boundary overlay
- Legend with comp identifiers

**Page 6 (optional): CAD Evidence Analysis**
- If CAD evidence has been obtained, analysis of their comps:
  - Which of their comps are stale (post-protest reductions)?
  - Which are from wrong neighborhoods?
  - Inconsistent adjustments?
  - Sale ratio analysis

**Page 7+ (optional): Condition Evidence**
- Photos of damage with descriptions
- Contractor estimates on letterhead
- Professional appraisal summary

**Final Page: Certification**
- "This evidence was prepared using official [County] Central Appraisal District data accessed on [date]"
- Data sources cited
- Prepared by: [name/Overtaxed]
- Date

### What This Achieves:
- **Looks like it was prepared by a licensed tax consultant**
- **Uses the same format and terminology as the CAD's own evidence**
- **Does all the math so the ARB just needs to verify**
- **Respects the 15-minute hearing constraint**
- **Gives the homeowner a script** — they know exactly what to say
- **Cites legal authority** — signals sophistication
- **Works for affidavit submission** (no appearance needed)
- **Print-friendly** — works in black and white on standard paper
