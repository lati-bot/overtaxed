## 1. What Is the CAD Evidence Packet?

The CAD evidence packet is the **County Appraisal District's case file** — the set of documents, data, and exhibits they will present to the Appraisal Review Board (ARB) to justify their appraised value of your property.

Think of it as the prosecution's case in a trial, except **they're required to show it to you before the hearing**.

### Key Facts

- **Typical size:** 5–15 pages for residential; 20–100+ pages for commercial
- **Format:** PDF (online portal) or printed packet (mail/in-person)
- **When available:** Must be provided at least **14 days before your hearing** (§41.461)
- **Cost:** **FREE** — as of HB 988 (2021), the CAD may not charge for copies regardless of delivery method (§41.461(b))

### What It Is NOT

- It is NOT a comprehensive appraisal report like a lender would produce
- It is NOT unbiased — it's built to support THEIR number
- It is NOT always accurate — errors are extremely common
- It is NOT final — you can challenge every piece of it

---

## 2. Your Legal Right to Get It

### The Law: §41.461

Under Texas Property Tax Code §41.461, the chief appraiser must:

1. **Deliver** a copy of the Comptroller's pamphlet (Property Taxpayer Remedies)
2. **Inform you** that you're entitled to a copy of all data, schedules, formulas, and information the CAD will introduce at the hearing
3. **Deliver** a copy of the ARB hearing procedures

All of this must happen **at least 14 days before the hearing**.

### The Enforcement Teeth: §41.67(d)

This is where it gets powerful:

> "Information that was previously requested under Section 41.461 by the protesting party that was not delivered to the protesting party at least 14 days before the scheduled or postponed hearing **may not be used or offered in any form as evidence** in the hearing, including as a document or through argument or testimony."

**Translation:** If you requested evidence and they didn't deliver it 14 days early, they CANNOT use it at the hearing. Period.

**Exception:** They can still use evidence to **rebut** something you bring up. But they can't use it proactively.

### The Real-World Problem

According to O'Connor & Associates (the largest property tax firm in Texas):

> "Unfortunately, most appraisal districts do not comply with this section of the tax code and the ARB panels do not enforce this issue at property tax protest hearings."

**What this means for homeowners:**
- Don't assume evidence will arrive automatically
- **Always request it in writing** to create a paper trail
- If they violate the 14-day rule, **object at the hearing** and ask the ARB to exclude their evidence
- Some counties (notably HCAD) do post it automatically to the online portal — but verify

### How to Access It by County

| County | Method | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Harris (HCAD)** | Online portal at owners.hcad.org → "View HCAD Hearing Evidence" | Generally reliable; auto-posted 15-20 days before hearing |
| **Travis (TCAD)** | Online protest account | Auto-uploaded when ARB date is scheduled |
| **Dallas (DCAD)** | Online portal (uFile) | Evidence typically available online |
| **Tarrant (TAD)** | Written request or online | Chandler Crouch's team systematically requests for 40,000+ clients |
| **Fort Bend (FBCAD)** | Online portal | Usually auto-posted |
| **Collin (CCAD)** | Online portal | Evidence typically available |
| **Others** | Written request recommended | Smaller counties may not have online portals; send physical letter |

## 3. What's Inside: Element-by-Element Breakdown

### 3.1 Property Record Card (PRC)

**What it is:** The CAD's official record of your property — their "file" on you.

**Contains:**
- Legal description and account number
- Land square footage / lot size
- Building living area (heated/cooled square feet)
- Year built and "effective age"
- Quality rating (e.g., "Average," "Good," "Excellent")
- Condition rating / CDU (Condition, Desirability, Utility)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Features: garage, pool, porch, deck, shed, etc.
- Depreciation factors
- Construction type and class

**Why it matters:** This is the foundation of their valuation. If ANY of this data is wrong, their entire calculation is wrong.

**Common errors found:**
- Wrong square footage (more common than you think — off by 50-200+ sqft)
- Wrong bedroom/bathroom count
- Pool listed that doesn't exist (or was removed)
- Features listed that were never built
- Condition rated too high (they say "Good," reality is "Average" or "Fair")
- Effective age not reflecting actual deterioration
- Missing negative factors (foundation issues, drainage problems, busy road)

### 3.2 Sales Comparables Grid

**What it is:** A table of recent property sales that CAD claims support their market value for your home.

**Typically contains:**
- Address of each comparable property
- Sale date and sale price
- Living area (square feet) and lot size
- Year built
- $/sq ft calculation
- Adjustments for differences (size, condition, features, location)
- Adjusted sale price
- Median or average of adjusted prices → their "supported" market value

**How many comps:** Usually 3-7 sales comparables, though some counties provide all neighborhood sales.

**Key metric — Sale Ratio:**
```
Sale Ratio = CAD's Current Appraised Value of Comp ÷ Actual Sale Price
```
- **1.00** = CAD value matches sale price exactly
- **Above 1.00** = CAD is overvaluing that comp relative to what it sold for
- **Below 1.00** = CAD is undervaluing it

### 3.3 Equity Comparables Grid

**What it is:** A list of similar properties and their *appraised values* per square foot — used to argue your home is valued consistently with neighbors.

**This is the "equal and uniform" argument.** Texas Tax Code §42.26(a)(3) allows protests based on whether your property is appraised equitably compared to similar properties.

**Contains:**
- Account numbers and addresses of comparable properties
- Appraised values
- Living area
- $/sq ft (appraised value ÷ living area)
- Property characteristics (year built, quality, condition)
- Median appraised value per square foot

**Key insight:** The CAD cherry-picks equity comps that support their number. They often **skip lower-valued homes** in the same neighborhood that would help your case.

### 3.4 Photos

**What they include:**
- Street-view photos (often from Google Street View or county drive-by imagery)
- Aerial/satellite photos
- Sometimes interior photos (rare for residential)

**Common problems:**
- Photos are **outdated** — may be 2-5 years old
- Don't show interior condition, deferred maintenance, or recent damage
- May show the property during peak curb appeal (summer with green lawn)
- Street view may hide defects visible from other angles

### 3.5 Property Sketch / Floor Plan

**What it is:** A basic outline of the building footprint with dimensions.

**Why it matters:** This is how they calculate square footage. If the sketch doesn't match reality, their square footage (and therefore their value) is wrong.

### 3.6 Maps

**What they show:** Location of your property relative to the selected comparables.

**What to look for:**
- Are comps actually nearby? (within 1 mile is ideal)
- Are comps across major roads, highways, or railroad tracks?
- Are comps in a different school district or attendance zone?
- Are comps in a different neighborhood or subdivision?
- Some CADs have been caught using comps in **entirely different zip codes**

### 3.7 Adjustment Tables / Schedules

**What they are:** The CAD's internal formulas for adding or subtracting value for property differences.

**Examples:**
- $40-60/sq ft for extra living area
- $10,000-25,000 for a pool
- $5,000-15,000 for a garage
- Age adjustments per year
- Quality/condition multipliers

**Problems:** Adjustments can be inconsistent, arbitrary, or unrealistic. If they give one comp $50/sq ft for extra space but another $35/sq ft, that's a red flag.

### 3.8 Cost Approach Data (Sometimes Included)

**What it is:** An estimate of what it would cost to rebuild your improvements from scratch, minus depreciation, plus land value.

**Formula:**
```
Replacement Cost New (RCN) - Depreciation + Land Value = Cost Approach Value
```

**When used:** Primarily for newer homes, custom homes, or unique properties where comparables are limited. Also used as a "reasonableness check" by some CADs.

### 3.9 Market Trend Data (Sometimes Included)

**What it is:** Neighborhood or area-wide market trend information — median prices over time, sales volume, price indices.

**Purpose:** To justify overall market increases that led to your higher appraisal.

### 3.10 Other Supporting Data

Some packets may also include:
- MLS listing information (if they have access)
- Building permits filed for your property
- Notes from CAD field appraisers
- Income approach data (commercial properties primarily)
- Sales questionnaire responses (if you voluntarily disclosed)

---

## 4. How CADs Get Sales Data in a Non-Disclosure State

Texas is one of only a handful of **non-disclosure states** — meaning sellers and buyers are NOT legally required to report the sale price to anyone. So how do CADs know what homes sell for?

### 4.1 MLS Access

**The biggest source.** Multiple methods:

- **Licensed realtors on staff:** HCAD (Harris County) is known to have licensed realtors on staff with direct MLS access. Per Reddit users: *"HCAD knows what the home sold for despite this being a non-disclosure state — they have licensed realtors on staff with access to the MLS, your evidence packet will include the sales price of your home if recently purchased."*

- **Broker agreements:** Some CADs negotiate direct data-sharing agreements with local MLS boards.

- **Third-party vendors (CoreLogic, ATTOM, Black Knight):** These companies aggregate MLS data and sell it to appraisal districts. A 2019 KVUE investigation revealed that Travis County (TCAD) purchased MLS data from CoreLogic for $24,300/year — including listing prices, sale prices, and in-house features. This caused a legal dispute with the Austin Board of Realtors (ABOR).

**How reliable:** Generally accurate for MLS-listed properties (which is the vast majority of residential sales). However, MLS doesn't capture:
- For Sale By Owner (FSBO) transactions
- Off-market sales
- Foreclosure and bank-owned sales (partial)
- Investor-to-investor transactions

### 4.2 Deed Filings and Mortgage Amounts

While sale prices aren't recorded on Texas deeds, **mortgage amounts are** (deed of trust). CADs can infer approximate sale prices:
- If someone gets an 80% LTV mortgage for $320,000, the home likely sold around $400,000
- New purchase mortgages vs. refinances can be distinguished
- This is less precise but provides a reasonable estimate

### 4.3 Sales Questionnaires

Many CADs mail **voluntary sales questionnaires** to recent buyers asking them to disclose the sale price. Fort Bend CAD, for example, actively promotes this on social media.

- **Not legally required** to respond
- Information provided is **confidential** under Tax Code §22.27
- Response rates are low (most tax professionals advise ignoring them)
- But some homeowners do respond, giving the CAD data points

### 4.4 Voluntary Disclosure

Some homeowners proactively share their sale price — particularly first-year homeowners trying to prevent over-appraisal. This is protected under the confidentiality provisions of §22.27.

### 4.5 Third-Party Data Aggregators

CADs subscribe to services that compile real estate transaction data:
- **CoreLogic:** Largest provider; aggregates MLS data, deed records, mortgage data
- **ATTOM Data Solutions:** Property data and analytics
- **Black Knight:** Mortgage and real estate data

As SquareDeal.tax notes: *"CADs buy the data anyway. You just pay for it indirectly."*

### 4.6 Comptroller's Property Tax Division

The Texas Comptroller's office conducts its own property value studies (for school funding calculations) and shares certain sales data with CADs.

### 4.7 How Reliable Is Their Sales Data?

**Mixed reliability:**
- MLS-sourced data is generally accurate (when they have access)
- Mortgage-inferred data is approximate (±5-15%)
- Off-market sales are often missed entirely
- They may have YOUR sale price but present it as if they just "know" — there's no verification requirement
- **Data can be stale** — their comp may show a sale price from before the comp owner's own protest reduced the value

**Key takeaway for homeowners:** The CAD likely knows your sale price if you bought through MLS. But they DON'T always have complete or accurate data on ALL sales in your neighborhood — which is a weakness you can exploit.

## 5. How to Counter EVERY Element

### 5.1 Countering Their Sales Comps

**Strategy: "Your comps don't prove what you think they prove."**

| CAD Weakness | Your Counter |
|---|---|
| Comps are too far away | "These comps are X miles from my property, across [major road/highway]. My neighborhood has different characteristics." |
| Comps are different size | "Your comp at 123 Oak is 2,800 sqft; my home is 2,100 sqft. Size adjustments don't fully account for this disparity." |
| Comps are newer/older | "Your comp was built in 2018; my home was built in 1995. The age adjustment doesn't capture 23 years of wear." |
| Comps are in better condition | "Your comp at 456 Pine was fully remodeled in 2023 — new kitchen, new bathrooms. My home has original 1995 fixtures." |
| Comps sold in different market conditions | "These sales occurred in [peak spring market / before interest rate changes]. Market conditions as of January 1 are different." |
| Comps are in a different neighborhood | "Your comp is in [different subdivision / school zone / neighborhood code]. These are materially different markets." |
| Comp had concessions | "Sale at 789 Elm included $15,000 in seller concessions, making the effective price lower than reported." |
| They cherry-picked high sales | "You selected the 5 highest sales in the area. There were 12 other sales below $X that you excluded." Bring those sales. |

**Power move:** Calculate the **sale ratio** for each of their comps. If ratios are inconsistent (ranging from 0.85 to 1.15), their grid is unreliable. Point this out explicitly.

### 5.2 Countering Their Equity Comps

**Strategy: "You cherry-picked. Here are the comps you conveniently left out."**

| CAD Weakness | Your Counter |
|---|---|
| They selected higher-valued comps | "In the same neighborhood code, there are X properties appraised at $Y/sqft or less that you excluded." |
| Comps have different quality ratings | "Your equity comp is rated 'Good' quality; my home is rated 'Average.' These aren't comparable." |
| Comps have features mine lacks | "Three of your five equity comps have pools. My property does not. Adjustments don't reflect this." |
| Some of their comps got reductions | "Comp at 123 Main was appraised at $250K in your evidence. After their protest, it was reduced to $215K. Your grid is stale." |
| They used comps from wrong neighborhood | "Two of these comps are in neighborhood code 7932.05; my property is in 7932.04. Different market areas." |

**Power move:** Build your own equity grid using properties from the **same neighborhood code** with **lower $/sqft** values. Focus on properties of similar size, age, quality, and condition. Calculate the **median** adjusted appraised value and show it's lower than what the CAD says your home is worth.

### 5.3 Countering Their Cost Approach

**Strategy: "Your replacement cost is inflated and depreciation is understated."**

| CAD Weakness | Your Counter |
|---|---|
| Replacement cost too high | "Your cost schedule assumes [premium construction / current material costs]. My home uses [standard / outdated materials]." |
| Depreciation understated | "You applied 15% depreciation for a 25-year-old home. Industry standards suggest 30-40% for this age and condition." |
| Effective age is wrong | "You show an effective age of 10 years for a 30-year-old home with no major renovations. This is unrealistic." |
| Functional obsolescence ignored | "My home has [outdated floor plan / single bathroom / galley kitchen / low ceilings] that buyers penalize." |
| External obsolescence ignored | "My property is on [busy road / near commercial zone / under flight path / next to power lines] — none reflected in your cost approach." |
| Land value inflated | "You valued my 7,000 sqft lot at $X. Similar lots in the area have sold for significantly less." |

### 5.4 Countering Their Photos

**Strategy: "Your photos tell a misleading story."**

| CAD Weakness | Your Counter |
|---|---|
| Photos are outdated | "These photos are from [year]. They don't show [current damage / deterioration / changes]." Bring dated photos. |
| Photos show only exterior | "Your photos don't show the interior: [cracked foundation / water damage / outdated kitchen / worn flooring]." Bring interior photos. |
| Photos show peak condition | "This street-view photo was taken in summer with landscaping at peak. As of January 1, the property looks like this." Show winter photo. |
| Photos miss defects | "Your aerial photo doesn't show [roof damage / drainage issues / retaining wall failure]." Bring close-up photos. |

**Best practice:** Bring **10-20 dated color photos** showing every defect: cracked foundation, aging roof, outdated interior, water stains, worn flooring, broken fixtures, deferred maintenance. Photos with timestamps are ideal.

### 5.5 Countering Their Property Data

**Strategy: "Your records are wrong — and wrong records mean wrong value."**

| Data Error | Your Counter |
|---|---|
| Wrong square footage | Bring a floor plan, builder specs, or independent measurement. "Your records show 2,400 sqft. My home is actually 2,150 sqft. At your $/sqft rate, that's a $X reduction." |
| Wrong bedroom/bathroom count | "You show 4 bedrooms. My home has 3 bedrooms and a study/office that doesn't have a closet and doesn't qualify as a bedroom." |
| Nonexistent features | "Your records show a pool. I do not have a pool." / "You list a 2-car garage. I have a 1-car garage." |
| Wrong year built | Bring building permit. "Your records show built in 2005. The permit shows 2001 with no major renovations." |
| Overstated condition | "You rate my home as 'Good' condition. Here are photos showing it's clearly 'Average' or 'Fair.'" |
| Missing negative factors | "Your records don't reflect that my property [backs to commercial / is on a flood plain / has easement restrictions / has foundation issues]." |

## 6. The Judo Move: Using Their Evidence Against Them

This is the "secret weapon" — turning the CAD's own data into YOUR best argument.

### 6.1 Find Comps in Their Grid That HELP You

Sometimes the CAD's evidence packet accidentally includes comparables that support a LOWER value for your home. Look for:

- Any comp with a lower $/sqft than your current appraisal
- Any comp that's in better condition but sold for less than your appraised value
- Any comp that's larger but valued at a lower total price

**At the hearing:** "Looking at YOUR OWN comparable at 456 Pine — which is 200 sqft larger than my home and has a pool — it's appraised at $20,000 less than mine. By your own data, my home should be valued lower."

### 6.2 Expose Stale Comps (The Hidden Gold)

**This is the single most powerful tactic most homeowners don't know about.**

CADs build their evidence grids early in the protest season using **preliminary values** from April/May. But as protest season progresses, many of those comp properties get their own values **reduced through their own protests**.

The CAD often does NOT update the grids for your case.

**What to do:**
1. Get the CAD's evidence packet
2. Look up EVERY comparable property on the CAD's public website
3. Check the **current appraised value** (post-protests)
4. Compare to the value shown in the CAD's evidence
5. Print/screenshot the current values

**Example:**
- CAD evidence shows comp at $225/sqft → that's the April preliminary value
- That homeowner protested and got reduced to $200/sqft → current value
- But CAD is still using $225 against YOU

**At the hearing:** "Your evidence shows the comp at 123 Oak valued at $225/sqft. However, that property's value was reduced after protest to $200/sqft. Your evidence is outdated and overstates market support."

### 6.3 Expose Inconsistent Sale Ratios

Calculate the sale ratio for each comp in their sales grid:
```
Sale Ratio = CAD Appraised Value ÷ Sale Price
```

If ratios are all over the place (some 0.90, some 1.10), their analysis is inconsistent. If they're overvaluing YOUR property relative to sale prices while undervaluing comps, that's **unequal appraisal** — which is its own separate protest ground.

### 6.4 Expose Inconsistent Adjustments

Compare how the CAD adjusts different comps:
- Do they apply $50/sqft for extra space on one comp but $35/sqft on another?
- Do they adjust $15,000 for a pool on one comp but $25,000 on another?
- Are age adjustments applied uniformly?

Any inconsistency undermines their methodology.

### 6.5 Use Their Evidence to Support Unequal Appraisal

Even if their market value argument is decent, you can still win on **equity**:
- Take their equity grid
- Add the comps they left out (lower-valued ones)
- Calculate the true median
- Show your home is above the median

"Using YOUR OWN neighborhood data and adding the properties you excluded, the median appraised value in my neighborhood is $X/sqft. My property is appraised at $Y/sqft — which is X% above the median. Under §42.26, this is unequal appraisal."

## 7. What Professional Firms Do With CAD Evidence

### 7.1 O'Connor & Associates (Largest Firm in Texas)

- **Files 50-100 page evidence packages** per protest
- **Always requests CAD evidence** — builds it into their systematic process
- Uses proprietary software to "tailor evidence to a format the appraisal district prefers"
- Compares CAD comps against their own analysis
- Reviews the CAD's property description vs. actual property
- Checks if CAD overstates quality or quantity of improvements
- Analyzes both market value AND unequal appraisal from CAD evidence
- Per O'Connor: *"Requesting appraisal district hearing evidence often provides evidence of a reduction and also limits what the appraisal district can present at the hearing."*

### 7.2 Chandler Crouch / FreeTaxProtest.com (Tarrant County)

- Protests **40,000+ properties per year** for free
- Systematic process explicitly includes: "Obtain all evidence that the appraisal district will use to support the value they are proposing"
- Step 6 of their process: **"Analyze the district's evidence to find flaws"**
- Step 7: "Research all comparable real estate sales data to identify the most effective sales data that supports a reduction"
- Step 8: "Assemble the most convincing evidence package possible"
- Claims to have figured out "the formula that TAD is using" and works backward from it
- Uses a spreadsheet to propose values with supporting evidence; if TAD rejects, asks "Do I have evidence to support a reduction?"

### 7.3 Ownwell

- Technology-driven approach
- Per their site: *"You will be given the TCAD's evidence packet via the online portal to compare your evidence against the county's"*
- Wizard walks homeowners through identifying deferred maintenance and property issues
- Focuses on comps-based evidence and condition factors

### 7.4 SquareDeal.tax

- Offers a **free CAD Evidence Review** tool
- Homeowners upload their CAD evidence PDF
- System automatically identifies: errors, favorable comps, stale values, and inconsistencies
- Highlights what helps the homeowner's case
- No data stored (privacy-first)
- Their blog provides the most detailed public analysis of CAD evidence tactics

### 7.5 What ALL Firms Have in Common

Every professional firm:
1. **Requests the CAD evidence packet** — it's step one
2. **Cross-references CAD comps** with their own analysis
3. **Looks for errors** in the property record card
4. **Checks for stale/outdated comp values**
5. **Builds counter-evidence** that directly addresses what the CAD will present
6. **Uses both market value AND unequal appraisal** arguments

**Overtaxed opportunity:** Automate what the pros do manually. Parse the CAD evidence, identify errors, flag stale comps, calculate sale ratios, and generate counter-arguments.

## 8. County-Specific Quirks

### Harris County (HCAD) — Houston

- **Most sophisticated** evidence system among Texas CADs
- Has **licensed realtors on staff** with MLS access → knows sale prices
- Evidence auto-posted to owners.hcad.org portal ("View HCAD Hearing Evidence")
- Available 15-20 days before hearing
- Evidence typically includes: property details, sales comps, equity comps, photos, maps
- iSettle offers based partly on this evidence
- The HCAD appraiser at informal/ARB "makes her response mostly based on the comparables" — so killing their comps effectively kills their case
- **Weakness:** HCAD's mass appraisal of 1.5M+ properties means errors are rampant; CAMA is only ~60% accurate per SquareDeal

### Dallas County (DCAD)

- uFile online portal for protests and evidence
- Per O'Connor: DCAD is "ill equipped to produce evidence for a volume of property tax protest hearings"
- May provide all neighborhood sales rather than just selected comps
- **Weakness:** Large county, spread-out geography — computer models fill in gaps

### Tarrant County (TAD) — Fort Worth

- Chandler Crouch has significantly impacted TAD's protest process (90,000+ protests filed some years)
- Blue "value notice" sent by mail
- Evidence available through TAD website or by request
- TAD uses mass appraisal with a statistical bell curve approach
- **Weakness:** Appraisal district staff famously tried to file complaints against Chandler Crouch for his effective use of their evidence against them — TAD employees were nearly fired as a result

### Travis County (TCAD) — Austin

- Evidence auto-posted to online protest account
- TCAD purchased MLS data through CoreLogic (caused ABOR legal dispute in 2018-2019)
- Per Reddit users: Evidence packets have been found to include comps that are "complete remodels with luxury appliances" compared to basic homes
- DIY protesters and firms both use the evidence; Travis County data shows firms often get uniform reductions across their portfolio (e.g., Ownwell got 7.6% for every house in one neighborhood)
- **Weakness:** Known for including comps from different neighborhoods or mismatching property types

### Collin County (CCAD)

- Uses Replacement Cost New (RCN) developed from actual historical costs or CCAD-developed valuation models
- Detailed cost schedules available
- **Weakness:** Cost approach data sometimes uses inflated RCN numbers

### Fort Bend County (FBCAD)

- Actively solicits voluntary sale price disclosure from homeowners
- Evidence available through online portal
- **Note:** One of the more aggressive CADs in seeking sales data

### Bexar County (BCAD) — San Antonio

- Per O'Connor: "ill equipped to produce evidence" for high-volume protests
- Under 2025-2026 reappraisal plan, BCAD may roll forward prior year values
- **Weakness:** Limited evidence production capacity

### Smaller / Rural Counties

- May not have online portals at all
- Written evidence request may be the only option
- Evidence quality varies widely — some provide minimal documentation
- Some counties provide **weaker evidence** that's easier to challenge
- The 14-day rule still applies, but enforcement is spotty

### When to Send It

- **Best practice:** Include with your Notice of Protest (Form 50-132) when you first file
- **Minimum:** At least 30 days before your expected hearing date
- **Method:** Certified mail with return receipt requested, OR through the online portal if your county offers it, OR email if your county accepts email requests
- **Keep proof:** Save the certified mail receipt, email confirmation, or portal screenshot — you may need it to object at the hearing

### Online vs. Written Request

| County | Online Adequate? | Written Recommended? |
|---|---|---|
| Harris (HCAD) | Yes — evidence auto-posts to iFile portal | Written backup is wise |
| Travis (TCAD) | Yes — auto-posts to online account | Written backup is wise |
| Dallas (DCAD) | Yes — uFile portal | Written backup is wise |
| Tarrant (TAD) | May work online | Written request stronger |
| Smaller counties | May not have online option | Written request essential |

**Pro tip:** Even if your county auto-posts evidence online, send the written request anyway. It creates an airtight paper trail if you need to object to late evidence.

## Key Takeaways for Overtaxed Product

### What to Build

1. **CAD Evidence Parser** — Upload the CAD's PDF, auto-extract comps, property details, and values
2. **Stale Comp Detector** — Cross-reference CAD evidence comp values against CURRENT appraised values in the CAD database; flag any that were reduced after protest
3. **Sale Ratio Calculator** — Auto-calculate sale ratios for each CAD comp; highlight inconsistencies
4. **Counter-Evidence Generator** — For each CAD comp, auto-generate potential counter-arguments based on distance, size difference, age difference, condition, and neighborhood
5. **Evidence Request Letter Generator** — Auto-fill the §41.461 request letter with the homeowner's property details and county-specific CAD address
6. **Error Spotter** — Compare CAD property record data against what the homeowner reports; flag discrepancies as protest ammunition

### Messaging for Customers

- "The CAD isn't just guessing — they have a case against you. Here's how to beat it."
- "Most homeowners never see the evidence the county plans to use. You should — it's free."
- "We found X errors in the county's evidence about your property. Here's how to use them."
- "The county's own data shows you're being overcharged. Let us show you how."

### Competitive Edge

- **No competitor** (O'Connor, Ownwell, NTPTS) gives homeowners this level of transparency into the CAD's case
- Teaching homeowners to use the CAD's evidence against them is a unique value proposition
- Automating stale comp detection would be a genuine innovation in the market
- This turns Overtaxed from "here's your evidence" into "here's your evidence AND here's how to destroy theirs"
