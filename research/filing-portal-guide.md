## Implementation Plan for Quick Start Guide

Instead of screenshots (which would be stale by the time notices drop), we should add:
1. **County-specific direct filing URLs** (clickable in the PDF — already done)
2. **Step-by-step numbered checklist** with exact portal button names (partially done)
3. **"What to select" callout box** — make the filing box more prominent with exact field names per portal

The current Quick Start Guide already has a good filing box with URL, account number, protest reason, value, and upload instructions. The main enhancement would be:
- Adding the direct protest filing URL (not just the CAD homepage)
- Adding county-specific portal names in the steps ("Click 'iFile Protest'" for Harris)
