# Competitor Product Teardown: Property Tax Protest/Appeal Services

**Prepared:** February 17, 2026
**Product:** Overtaxed (getovertaxed.com) — $49 protest/evidence packages
**Purpose:** Understand what competitors deliver, how they price, and where Overtaxed fits

---

## Executive Summary

The property tax protest industry has three distinct tiers:

1. **Full-service contingency firms** (Ownwell, Texas Protax, O'Connor, NTPTS, Home Tax Shield) — They file, attend hearings, negotiate. Charge 25–50% of savings. Customer does nothing.
2. **Flat-fee evidence/DIY packages** (AppealDesk, PropertyTaxReduction/Rainbolt, TaxLasso, DIY Tax Appeals LLC, SquareDeal.tax) — They provide comp analysis and evidence docs. Customer files themselves. $49–$160 flat fee.
3. **Free services** (Chandler Crouch/FreeTaxProtest.com) — Realtor-funded, Tarrant County only. Completely free.

**Overtaxed at $49 sits squarely in Tier 2** — and faces a direct, nearly identical competitor in **AppealDesk** ($49, same model, same deliverables). PropertyTaxReduction.com charges $59.95 for a similar report.

**Key finding:** The biggest gap between Overtaxed/Tier 2 and the full-service firms isn't the evidence quality — it's the **hearing representation**. Most homeowners are scared of hearings and value someone else showing up. The evidence packages from flat-fee services are often comparable or identical to what the big firms use.

**The opportunity:** Overtaxed can beat every competitor in Tier 2 on deliverable quality and match Tier 1 on evidence quality, while charging 5–10x less. The specific gaps to close are: unequal appraisal analysis, condition/CDU adjustments, and county-specific filing automation.

---

### 6. TaxProper (taxproper.com) — PIVOTED

**Overview:** Originally a YC-backed consumer property tax appeal tool. Raised $2M in 2020. Was the closest competitor model to Overtaxed.

**Status:** **TaxProper has pivoted away from consumer property tax appeals.** The domain now redirects to **Mainstay.io** — an enterprise SaaS solution for large real estate operators. Their current product:
- Acquires real-time property tax data
- Encodes local tax rules
- Contains operational workflows for property tax management
- Automates property tax payments and forecasting
- Targets large real estate operators, not individual homeowners

**Historical data (pre-pivot):**
- Average per-customer savings of ~$700
- Was available in limited markets
- Offered automated comparable analysis

**What this means for Overtaxed:** TaxProper tried the consumer tech-DIY model and ultimately abandoned it for enterprise. This suggests the consumer model is harder to scale profitably — OR that they simply found a bigger market in enterprise. Either way, there's now a gap where TaxProper used to be.

## Customer Sentiment Analysis

### What Homeowners Love About Professional Services
- "Set it and forget it" convenience
- Don't have to attend hearings
- Companies know the system and the people
- Consistent year-over-year reductions
- No risk (only pay if they save you)

### What Homeowners Hate About Professional Services
- **Giving away 25-50% of savings** — "I don't want to pay $500 for something I could do myself"
- **Auto-renewal** catching people off guard
- **Fee on market value reduction** even when no actual tax savings (capped value issue)
- **Blanket settlements** — high-volume firms accept across-the-board deals instead of fighting each property
- **Slow communication** during peak season (May-August)
- **Feel like a number** at large firms
- **Charging for homestead exemption filing** that's free to do yourself

### What DIY Protesters Say They Need
From Reddit threads (r/houston, r/dallas, r/austin, r/chicago, r/realestate):

1. **"How do I find comps if I'm not a realtor?"** — Texas is a non-disclosure state. Getting comp sales data is the #1 barrier for DIY.
2. **"I don't know what evidence to bring"** — People want a checklist and examples
3. **"I'm scared of the hearing"** — People fear face-to-face confrontation
4. **"What if they raise my taxes?"** — Fear of backfire (rarely happens)
5. **"The iSettle/online process is confusing"** — Want step-by-step help with the digital systems
6. **"I don't know if my value is actually too high"** — Want an objective assessment first
7. **"What works for equity/unequal appraisal vs market value arguments?"** — Don't understand the two protest types

### What Successful DIY Protesters Did
From Reddit and YouTube tutorials:
1. **Downloaded HCAD/CAD evidence file** — compared the district's own comps
2. **Found unflattering photos** of comps on HAR to show they're more updated
3. **Checked square footage** — errors in CAD records are common
4. **Used the "equity" argument** — showing neighbors have lower assessed values per sq ft
5. **Took bad photos of their own house** — unflattering angles, deferred maintenance
6. **Brought repair estimates** — foundation, roof, HVAC issues
7. **Used recent purchase price** — if bought below assessed value
8. **Presented calmly and with data** — "focus on evidence, don't argue"

### YouTube Tutorial Insights
The most successful YouTube content on property tax protests teaches:
- How to read your appraisal notice
- Where to find comps (HAR, Zillow, CAD websites)
- The difference between market value and unequal appraisal arguments
- How to calculate price per sq ft for equity analysis
- What the informal hearing process looks like (it's not scary)
- Chandler Crouch's videos are the gold standard — millions of views, step-by-step walkthroughs

## What the BEST Possible Protest Package Would Include

Based on analyzing every competitor's deliverables and every successful DIY protest, here's the ultimate evidence package:

### Tier 1: Core Evidence (What Overtaxed should deliver at minimum)
1. **Comparable Sales Analysis** — 5-10 recent sales within 0.5 miles, adjusted for size/features/condition
2. **Unequal Appraisal / Equity Analysis** — 5-10 similar properties showing lower $/sq ft assessed values
3. **Property Record Accuracy Check** — Flag errors in CAD records (wrong sq ft, wrong bed/bath count, missing damage)
4. **Assessment History** — Year-over-year value changes for context
5. **Filing Guide** — County-specific deadline, form links, step-by-step instructions
6. **Cover Letter / Template** — Ready-to-submit protest letter

### Tier 2: Premium Evidence (What would make Overtaxed BETTER than firms charging 3-6x more)
7. **CAD Evidence File Analysis** — Download the appraisal district's evidence and annotate/rebut it
8. **Comp Quality Scores** — Rate each comp for relevance (distance, age, size, condition similarity)
9. **Photo Guide** — Instructions on exactly what photos to take and why (unflattering angles for your home, HAR listing photos for comps)
10. **Hearing Script** — What to say at informal hearing, how to present, common questions and responses
11. **Condition/CDU Adjustment Analysis** — Compare condition ratings between your property and comps
12. **Online Filing Walkthrough** — Screenshots of iFile/iSettle or equivalent system, step by step
13. **Exemption Checker** — Flag if homestead, over-65, disabled veteran, or ag exemptions are missing
14. **"What To Expect" Guide** — Demystify the hearing process (97% resolved without formal hearing)

### Tier 3: Differentiation (What no one else does)
15. **AI-Powered CAD Record Scanner** — Automatically detect square footage discrepancies, feature errors
16. **Neighborhood Heat Map** — Visual showing where assessments are highest/lowest per sq ft
17. **Success Probability Score** — Based on historical reduction data for the county/subdivision
18. **Multi-Year Strategy Brief** — How this year's reduction compounds over 2-3 years
19. **Video Explainer** — 5-minute personalized walkthrough of your specific evidence package
20. **Post-Hearing Follow-Up Guide** — What to do if initial protest fails, how to escalate

## Where Overtaxed at $49 Fits in the Market

### The Good News
- **Price is competitive:** Tied with AppealDesk as the cheapest flat-fee evidence product
- **"Keep 100% of savings" messaging is powerful** — directly attacks the contingency model
- **Market gap exists:** TaxProper (the YC-backed tech-DIY competitor) pivoted away, leaving an opening
- **The evidence is the easy part:** Comp data is fundamentally commoditizable
- **Homeowner sentiment supports it:** Reddit is full of "I don't want to pay someone 30-40% for this"

### The Challenges
- **AppealDesk exists** and is almost identically positioned ($49, same deliverables, 50-state coverage)
- **PropertyTaxReduction is established** ($59.95, Texas focus, Rainbolt & Co backing, BBB accredited)
- **Ownwell's 25% contingency is "free to try"** — no upfront risk, hard to compete with on psychology
- **Chandler Crouch is literally FREE** for Tarrant County — proves this work can be given away
- **O'Connor gives away FREE DIY evidence** for out-of-Texas properties
- **Trust factor:** Homeowners may prefer paying more for a known brand with reviews

### Specific Gaps to Close (vs AppealDesk specifically)
AppealDesk currently delivers:
- ✅ Comparable sales analysis
- ✅ Filing guide with county-specific deadlines
- ✅ Pre-written cover letter
- ✅ Assessment discrepancy calculation
- ✅ Maps and market data
- ✅ 50-state coverage

**Overtaxed needs to match or exceed ALL of these, plus add:**
1. **Unequal appraisal / equity analysis** (the second most powerful protest argument)
2. **Hearing preparation script** (what to say, what not to say)
3. **Photo guide** (exactly what photos to take for your property)
4. **Online filing walkthrough** (county-specific screenshots)
5. **Exemption checker** (are you missing free money?)

---

## Features/Content That Would Make Overtaxed BETTER Than Services Charging 3-6x More

### 1. Two-Pronged Evidence Attack ($49 delivers what $200+ firms provide)
Most DIY tools only provide comparable sales. Full-service firms ALSO use unequal appraisal (equity) arguments. **Overtaxed should provide BOTH** — this is the single biggest quality gap to close.

### 2. "Hearing in a Box"
Full-service firms' main value prop is hearing attendance. Counter this by making the hearing so easy the customer doesn't need a representative:
- 5-minute video walkthrough of what the hearing looks like
- Script with exact phrases to use
- "Worst case / best case" scenarios
- FAQ of common appraiser rebuttals and how to respond

### 3. CAD Evidence File Rebuttal
In Texas, you can request the appraisal district's evidence 14 days before your hearing. **No DIY tool helps homeowners analyze and rebut this.** Overtaxed could:
- Accept the CAD evidence file as an upload
- Automatically compare their comps to yours
- Generate rebuttal notes ("Their comp #3 is 500 sq ft larger and has a pool — not comparable")

### 4. Condition/Photo Strategy Guide
From Reddit, the most effective DIY tactic is unflattering photos. Provide:
- Checklist of what to photograph (foundation cracks, aging HVAC, old kitchen)
- How to photograph effectively (bad lighting, wide angles showing wear)
- Compare to HAR listing photos of comps (show their kitchens are renovated, yours isn't)

### 5. Exemption Audit
Many homeowners are missing exemptions worth more than any protest. Quick automated check:
- Homestead exemption filed?
- Over-65 or disabled?
- Disabled veteran?
- Agricultural use?
- Solar panel exemption?
This is pure value-add that costs nothing to deliver.

### 6. Success Probability & Historical Data
No competitor tells you upfront "you have a 78% chance of winning and should target a $X reduction." Overtaxed could use public CAD data to:
- Show historical reduction rates by county/subdivision
- Calculate expected value of the protest
- Set realistic expectations (builds trust)

### 7. Post-Protest Lifecycle
- What to do when you win (expect refund check or escrow adjustment)
- What to do when you lose (file with ARB, appeal to state)
- Set a reminder for next year
- Year-over-year tracking

## Key Takeaways

1. **The $49 flat-fee evidence package market is real but small** — AppealDesk is the primary competitor, with PropertyTaxReduction.com at $60 as secondary. Everyone else is contingency-based full-service.

2. **The evidence itself is commoditized** — All firms use the same two arguments (comp sales + equity). The data comes from the same public sources. The value of full-service firms is convenience and hearing attendance, not superior evidence.

3. **Unequal appraisal analysis is the biggest evidence gap** for DIY tools. Adding this instantly puts Overtaxed on par with full-service firms' evidence quality.

4. **The hearing is the fear barrier** — 97% of protests resolve without a formal hearing, but homeowners don't know this. Education and hearing prep materials are the bridge.

5. **Trust and reviews matter enormously** — Ownwell, O'Connor, and Texas Protax have hundreds/thousands of reviews. Overtaxed needs social proof fast.

6. **IL (Cook County) is a different beast** than TX — triennial reassessment, multiple appeal levels (Assessor → BOR → PTAB → Circuit Court), more complex process. The $49 price point is especially attractive here since IL contingency fees are 30-50%.

7. **The compounding value message is underused** — A successful protest saves money for 1-3 years. At $49, the ROI story is incredible (126x return on $49 per AppealDesk's math).

8. **Auto-renewal is a love/hate feature** — Full-service firms auto-renew. A flat-fee model could offer annual reminders without the auto-renewal baggage.
