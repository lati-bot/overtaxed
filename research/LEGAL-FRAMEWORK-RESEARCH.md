# PART 1: TEXAS — PROPERTY TAX PROTEST STATUTES

<a name="4141"></a>
## 1. Texas Tax Code §41.41 — Right of Protest

### Key Operative Language
A property owner is entitled to protest before the appraisal review board the following actions:

**(a)(1)** determination of the **appraised value** of the owner's property or, in the case of land appraised as provided by Subchapter C, D, E, or H, Chapter 23, determination of its appraised or market value;

**(a)(2)** **unequal appraisal** of the owner's property;

**(a)(3)** inclusion of the owner's property on the appraisal records;

**(a)(4)** denial to the property owner in whole or in part of a partial exemption;

**(a)(4-a)** [effective 2024] determination that the owner's property does not qualify for the **circuit breaker limitation** on appraised value provided by §23.231;

**(a)(5)** determination that the owner's land does not qualify for agricultural/open-space appraisal;

**(a)(6)** identification of taxing units in which the owner's property is taxable;

**(a)(7)** determination that the property owner is the owner of property;

**(a)(8)** determination that a change in use of land under special appraisal has occurred;

**(a)(9)** **any other action** of the chief appraiser, appraisal district, or ARB that applies to and **adversely affects** the property owner.

**(b)** Chief appraiser must publicize these rights annually.

**(d)** **No fee** may be charged in connection with a protest.

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- **§41.41(a)(1)** and **(a)(2)** are the two primary grounds we file on — market value and unequal appraisal
- The protest form must now allow a property owner to **select a single box for either or both** value/equity protests (added by HB 988/2021)
- The catch-all provision (a)(9) gives broad standing for any adverse action

### What to Cite
- **§41.41(a)(1)** — for market value protests
- **§41.41(a)(2)** — for unequal appraisal/equity protests
- **§41.41(d)** — protests are free (important to mention in user education)

### Common Misunderstandings
- Many homeowners think you can only protest if your value went up — FALSE, you can protest any year
- Some think you must choose between market value and equity — you can (and should) protest on BOTH grounds simultaneously

## 2. Texas Tax Code §42.26 — Remedy for Unequal Appraisal

### Key Operative Language
The district court (and by extension the ARB under §41.43(b)) shall grant relief on the ground that a property is appraised unequally if:

**(a)(1)** the **appraisal ratio** of the property exceeds by at least **10 percent** the **median level of appraisal** of a reasonable and representative sample of other properties in the appraisal district;

**(a)(2)** the **appraisal ratio** of the property exceeds by at least **10 percent** the **median level of appraisal** of a sample of properties in the appraisal district consisting of a **reasonable number** of other properties **similarly situated** to, or of the **same general kind or character** as, the property subject to the appeal; OR

**(a)(3)** the **appraised value** of the property exceeds the **median appraised value** of a **reasonable number of comparable properties appropriately adjusted**.

### Relief Standard (§42.26(b))
- If entitled to relief under (a)(1): value changed to median level per (a)(1)
- If entitled to relief under (a)(2): value changed to median level per (a)(2)
- If entitled to relief under **(a)(3): value changed to median appraised value per (a)(3)**
- If entitled under **more than one subdivision**: court orders the **lowest** resulting value
- Court determines each applicable median — **not required to adopt either party's proposed median**
- Court **may not deny relief** under one subdivision because another yields a higher value

### Critical Provision — §42.26(d)
For unequal appraisal purposes, when a property is subject to the **§23.23 homestead cap** or **§23.231 circuit breaker**, the comparison must use **market value** (not capped value) for both the subject property and comparable properties.

### What "Reasonable Number" and "Appropriately Adjusted" Mean
- The statute does **NOT define** "reasonable number" — this is left to the trier of fact
- In practice, ARBs and courts typically accept **5-20 comparable properties**
- "Appropriately adjusted" means adjustments for **differences in size, age, condition, location, features** — standard real estate appraisal practice
- The **median** (not mean/average) is the standard

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- **§42.26(a)(3) is our primary equity argument** — showing that the subject's appraised value exceeds the median of comparable properties
- This is the standard that applies at the ARB level through §41.43(b)(3)
- We should be pulling 5-10 comparable properties and showing the median

### What to Cite
- **§42.26(a)(3)** — primary unequal appraisal standard (comparable properties)
- **§42.26(b)** — relief = lowest value among applicable tests
- **§42.26(d)** — must use market value for homestead-capped properties

## 3. Texas Tax Code §41.43 — Protest of Determination of Value or Inequality of Appraisal

### Key Operative Language — Burden of Proof

**Default Rule — §41.43(a):**
In a protest under §41.41(a)(1) or (2), the **appraisal district has the burden** of establishing the value of the property by a **preponderance of the evidence** presented at the hearing. If the district fails, **the protest shall be determined in favor of the property owner**.

**Enhanced Standard — §41.43(a-1) — Private Appraisal Filed:**
If the property has a market/appraised value of **$1 million or less** AND the owner files a **certified appraisal** (performed within 180 days) at least 14 days before the hearing, the district must establish value by **clear and convincing evidence**. (Higher burden on the district.)

**Enhanced Standard — §41.43(a-3) — Value Was Lowered Last Year:**
The district has the **clear and convincing evidence** burden if:
1. The appraised value was **lowered in the preceding tax year**;
2. The lower value was **not from a written settlement agreement** under §1.111(e); AND
3. The owner files **supporting information** (comps, income/expense) at least 14 days before hearing.

**Important: §41.43(a-5):** Subsection (a-3)(3) does NOT impose a duty on the owner to provide information. It's merely a **condition** to trigger the higher standard.

### Unequal Appraisal Standard — §41.43(b)
A protest on the ground of unequal appraisal **shall be determined in favor of the protesting party UNLESS** the appraisal district establishes that:

**(b)(1)** the appraisal ratio ≤ median level of a reasonable/representative sample; OR

**(b)(2)** the appraisal ratio ≤ median level of a sample of similar properties; OR

**(b)(3)** the **appraised value ≤ median appraised value of a reasonable number of comparable properties appropriately adjusted**.

### Burden Shift — §41.43(d)
If the property owner **fails to deliver a rendition statement or property report** required by Chapter 22, or fails to respond to a §22.07(c) information request, the **burden shifts to the property owner** (preponderance standard).

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- **CRITICAL**: The burden is on the CAD, not the homeowner (for residential properties under $1M)
- Our packets should emphasize: "The district bears the burden of proving value"
- If we can get a certified appraisal, the burden becomes "clear and convincing" — much harder for the CAD
- Filing supporting comps 14 days before hearing triggers higher burden IF value was lowered last year

### What to Cite
- **§41.43(a)** — burden on CAD (preponderance)
- **§41.43(a-1)** — enhanced burden with certified appraisal
- **§41.43(b)(3)** — unequal appraisal standard (median of comps)

## 4. Texas Tax Code §41.44 — Notice of Protest

### Filing Deadlines — §41.44(a)
A protest must be filed:

**(a)(1)** Not later than **May 15** OR the **30th day after notice of appraised value** was delivered, **whichever is later**;

**(a)(2)** For changes ordered by ARB/Chapter 25: 30th day after notice of change;

**(a)(3)** For ag-use change: 30th day after notice;

### Late Filing — §41.44(b)
A property owner who files **after the deadline but before the ARB approves the appraisal records** is entitled to a hearing if they show **good cause** for failure to file on time.

### Additional Late Filing Exceptions
- **§41.44(c)**: Failure-to-give-notice protests (§41.411): can file before taxes become delinquent
- **§41.44(c-1)**: Gulf of Mexico offshore workers (20+ continuous days)
- **§41.44(c-2)**: Active duty military outside the US

### Notice Requirements — §41.44(d)
A notice of protest is sufficient if it:
1. **Identifies the protesting property owner** (including a person claiming ownership interest even if not on records)
2. **Identifies the property** that is the subject of the protest
3. **Indicates apparent dissatisfaction** with some determination

The notice **need not be on an official form**. The comptroller prescribes a form, but it's not required. The form must allow a single box to protest for **either or both** value and equity reasons.

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- Most users will file by **May 15 or 30 days after notice** — our product must track these dates
- We should help users file EARLY, not late
- The notice is minimal — just identify yourself, your property, and say you disagree
- Late filing with good cause is a safety valve but shouldn't be relied upon

### What to Cite
- **§41.44(a)(1)** — filing deadline
- **§41.44(d)** — minimal notice requirements

<a name="41461"></a>
## 5. Texas Tax Code §41.461 — Notice of Certain Matters Before Hearing; Delivery of Requested Information

### Key Operative Language
At least **14 days before** a hearing on a protest, the chief appraiser shall:

**(a)(1)** deliver a copy of the **comptroller's taxpayer assistance pamphlet** (§5.06);

**(a)(2)** inform the property owner that the owner or agent is **entitled on request to a copy of the data, schedules, formulas, and all other information** the chief appraiser will introduce at the hearing;

**(a)(3)** deliver a copy of the **hearing procedures** adopted by the ARB.

### FREE COPIES — §41.461(b) [Added by HB 988, 2021]
**The chief appraiser may NOT charge a property owner or the designated agent for copies provided under this section, regardless of the manner in which the copies are prepared or delivered.**

### Delivery Methods — §41.461(c)
Information must be delivered by:
1. Regular first-class mail; OR
2. Electronically (if owner elected electronic communications under §1.085); OR
3. By referring to a **secure Internet website** or the **exact URL** on the appraisal district website where the information is identifiable and readily available.

### §41.461(d) — If Online Reference Used
If the CAD refers to a website, the notice must contain a **conspicuous statement** that the owner can receive information by mail or in person on request.

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- **ALWAYS request the CAD's evidence** — this is the single most important pre-hearing action
- The CAD must provide it **at least 14 days before hearing**
- It's **FREE** (HB 988, effective 2021)
- This is how we know what comps the CAD is using — we can then counter them

### What to Cite
- **§41.461(a)(2)** — right to request all CAD evidence
- **§41.461(b)** — copies must be free
- **§41.67(d)** — consequence of failure to provide (evidence excluded)

---

<a name="4145"></a>
## 6. Texas Tax Code §41.45 — Hearing on Protest

### Key Provisions

**Scheduling (a):** ARB must schedule hearing as soon as practicable, not later than 90th day after board approves appraisal records.

**Appearance Options (b):**
- Property owner may appear **in person**
- May offer evidence or argument **by affidavit** without appearing
- May appear by **telephone conference call or videoconference**
- If appearing by phone/video, evidence must be submitted by affidavit
- Affidavit must be submitted **before the board begins hearing**

**Remote Hearing (b-1):** ARB **shall** conduct a hearing by phone or video if the owner notifies the board at least 10 days before the hearing.

**Single-Member Panel (b-4):** Owner may request a **single-member panel** in the notice of protest or 10 days before hearing. If the single-member panel's recommendation is not accepted by the full board, the board may refer for rehearing or determine the protest.

**Chief Appraiser Must Appear (c):** The chief appraiser **shall appear at each protest hearing** to represent the appraisal office.

**Postponements (e):**
- **One free postponement** without cause if owner hasn't designated an agent and requests before the hearing date
- **Unlimited postponements** with good cause or chief appraiser consent
- Postponement request can be made in writing, by phone, by fax, by email, or in person

**Material Exchange (h):** Before or at the start of hearing, each party must provide the other a copy of any written material or portable-device material they intend to offer.

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- Users can attend hearings **by phone or video** — critical for accessibility
- **Single-member panels** may be friendlier and faster
- **One free postponement** is valuable if users need more time to prepare
- We should instruct users to submit affidavits if they can't attend

### What to Cite
- **§41.45(b)** — appearance options (affidavit, phone, video)
- **§41.45(b-1)** — right to remote hearing
- **§41.45(b-4)** — single-member panel option
- **§41.45(e)** — one free postponement

## 7. Texas Tax Code §41.47 — Determination of Protest

### Key Operative Language

**(a)** The ARB hearing a protest shall determine the protest and make its decision **by written order**.

**(b)** If the board finds the appraisal records are incorrect in some respect raised by the protest, the board **shall correct the appraisal records** by changing the appraised value or making other necessary changes.

**(c)** If the protest is about appraised value, the ARB **must state in the order**:
- The appraised value as shown in records submitted by chief appraiser
- The appraised value as **finally determined by the board**
- For real property: **land value and improvement value stated separately**

### 🔑 CRITICAL: §41.47(c-2) — ARB CANNOT RAISE VALUE
**"The board may NOT determine the appraised value of the property that is the subject of a protest to be an amount GREATER than the appraised value of the property as shown in the appraisal records submitted to the board by the chief appraiser."**

Exception: Unless **requested and agreed to by the property owner**. Also does not apply to exemption/ag-use protests.

**(d)** Board shall deliver the order by certified mail (or electronically if elected).

**(e)** Notice must include a **prominently printed statement** about the right to appeal to district court, with deadlines.

**(f)** Board must issue order within **30 days** after hearing concludes (45 days in counties of 4M+ population).

**(g)/(g-1)** Chief appraiser and owner can file a **joint motion for agreed order** (settlement). Board must issue within 5 days.

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- **§41.47(c-2) is the key reassurance**: protesting CANNOT make your value go UP
- This should be prominently stated in our product materials to encourage protests
- The settlement option (g) is how most protests actually resolve — informal discussions before hearing

### What to Cite
- **§41.47(c-2)** — ARB cannot raise value (key user reassurance)
- **§41.47(g)** — agreed order / settlement mechanism

---

<a name="4167"></a>
## 8. Texas Tax Code §41.67 — Evidence

### Key Operative Language

**(a)** ARB members may swear witnesses. **All testimony must be given under oath.**

**(b)** Documentary evidence may be admitted **as copies** if the board determines the original is not readily available.

**(c)** **Official notice** may be taken of judicially cognizable facts.

### 🔑 §41.67(d) — Exclusion of CAD Evidence Not Timely Shared
**"Information that was previously requested under §41.461 by the protesting party that was NOT delivered to the protesting party at least 14 days before the scheduled or postponed hearing may NOT be used or offered in any form as evidence in the hearing, including as a document or through argument or testimony."**

Exception: Information offered to **rebut** evidence or argument presented by the protesting party.

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- **ALWAYS REQUEST EVIDENCE** — if the CAD fails to provide it 14 days before hearing, that evidence is EXCLUDED
- This is a powerful procedural tool — request evidence immediately after filing protest
- The CAD can still use evidence to rebut what we present
- Copies are admissible — we don't need originals

### What to Cite
- **§41.67(d)** — evidence exclusion rule (must be provided 14 days before hearing)
- **§41.461(a)(2)** — the right to request the evidence

---

<a name="41a"></a>
## 9. Texas Tax Code §41A — Binding Arbitration

### §41A.01 — Right of Appeal by Property Owner
As an **alternative to filing a district court appeal** (§42.01), a property owner is entitled to appeal through **binding arbitration** an ARB order on a protest under §41.41(a)(1) or (2) if:

**(1)** the property qualifies as the owner's **residence homestead** under §11.13; OR

**(2)** the appraised or market value of the property as determined by the ARB order is **$5 million or less**.

### §41A.03 — Request for Arbitration
Must file with the comptroller **not later than the 60th day** after receiving notice of the ARB order.

**Arbitration Deposit:**
| Property Type | Value | Deposit |
|---|---|---|
| Residence homestead | ≤ $500,000 | **$450** |
| Residence homestead | > $500,000 | **$500** |
| Non-homestead | ≤ $1 million | **$500** |
| Non-homestead | $1M – $2M | **$800** |
| Non-homestead | $2M – $3M | **$1,050** |
| Non-homestead | $3M – $5M | **$1,550** |

### §41A.03(b) — Waiver
- Failure to **strictly comply** waives the right to arbitration
- Filing a **district court appeal** waives the right to arbitration (and vice versa)

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- This is a **post-ARB escalation path** for users who lose at the ARB
- $450-$500 for homesteads is affordable
- Binding arbitration is generally considered more favorable to property owners than district court
- Must file within **60 days** of ARB order

### What to Cite
- **§41A.01** — eligibility for binding arbitration
- **§41A.03** — filing requirements and deposit amounts

<a name="2323"></a>
## 10. Texas Tax Code §23.23 — Limitation on Appraised Value of Residence Homestead (10% Cap)

### Key Operative Language

**(a)** An appraisal office may increase the appraised value of a residence homestead for a tax year to an amount **not to exceed the lesser of:**

**(1)** the **market value** of the property for the most recent tax year that the market value was determined; OR

**(2)** the **sum of:**
- **(A)** 10 percent of the appraised value for the preceding tax year;
- **(B)** the appraised value for the preceding tax year; AND
- **(C)** the market value of all **new improvements**.

**In plain English:** The appraised value (what you're taxed on) can only go up by **10% per year** above the prior year's appraised value, regardless of market value changes. But the market value is still tracked separately.

**(b)** Chief appraiser must include in records **BOTH** the market value and the §23.23(a)(2) computed value.

**(c)** The limitation takes effect January 1 of the tax year **following the first year** the owner qualifies for homestead exemption. Expires when neither owner nor spouse qualifies.

**(e)** "New improvement" means an improvement made **after the most recent appraisal** that increases market value and is not included in prior year's appraised value. **Does NOT include repairs or ordinary maintenance.**

### Interaction with Protests
- The 10% cap is a **separate protection** from the protest process
- You protest the **market value** — if you lower the market value, the cap applies to the lower value
- Per §42.26(d), unequal appraisal comparisons for homesteads must use **market value**, not capped value
- Lowering market value through protest can have long-term compounding benefits due to the cap

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- Users should understand: even if you don't protest, your appraised value can only increase 10%/year
- BUT protesting the market value is still important because the cap is based on the LOWER of market value or 10% increase
- If market value is protested down, the cap resets to the lower base

### What to Cite
- **§23.23(a)** — the 10% cap formula
- **§23.23(b)** — both values tracked

<a name="1113"></a>
## 11. Texas Tax Code §11.13 — Residence Homestead Exemption

### Key Provisions (as amended by SB 2/2023, Prop 4/2023, and SB 4/2025, Prop 13/2025)

**(b)** An adult is entitled to exemption from taxation by a **school district** of **$100,000** of the appraised value of the adult's residence homestead.
- **Increased to $140,000** effective January 1, 2025 by Prop 13 (November 2025) and SB 4 (2025 session)

**(c)** An adult who is **disabled or 65 or older** is entitled to an **additional $10,000** school district exemption.
- **Prop 11 (2025)** increased this to **$60,000** for elderly/disabled, effective January 1, 2025

**(d)/(e)** Other taxing units (cities, counties) may adopt their own additional homestead exemptions (minimum $3,000).

**(n)** Taxing units may adopt a **percentage exemption** (up to 20% of appraised value, minimum $5,000).

### Current Status (as of 2026)
| Exemption | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| School district general homestead | **$140,000** | §11.13(b), Prop 13/2025 |
| School district 65+/disabled additional | **$60,000** | §11.13(c), Prop 11/2025 |
| County/city optional | Varies by jurisdiction | §11.13(d)(n) |

### Residence Homestead Definition — §11.13(j)
A structure (including mobile home) that is:
- Owned by one or more individuals (directly or through qualifying trust)
- Designed/adapted for human residence
- Used as a residence
- Occupied as the individual's **principal residence**
- Includes up to **20 acres** of land

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- We should verify users have filed for the homestead exemption (many miss it)
- The exemption reduces taxable value significantly — $140K off for school taxes
- For a $400K home: taxable value for school taxes = $260K instead of $400K
- The exemption + 10% cap + protest = maximum savings strategy

## 13. Can the ARB Raise Your Value?

### Answer: **NO** — Confirmed by §41.47(c-2)

**Statutory Text:** "The board may NOT determine the appraised value of the property that is the subject of a protest to be an amount greater than the appraised value of the property as shown in the appraisal records submitted to the board by the chief appraiser under Section 25.22 or 25.23, **except as requested and agreed to by the property owner**."

**Exceptions (where value COULD increase):**
1. Only if the property owner **requests and agrees** to an increase (essentially never happens)
2. Does not apply to protests about **exemption cancellation/denial** or **ag-use disqualification** (because those actions inherently raise the taxable value)

**Bottom line for our product:** Protesting your property taxes can ONLY result in:
- Your value **staying the same** (worst case), or
- Your value going **DOWN** (the goal)

This should be prominently featured in our marketing and user education materials.

# PART 2: ILLINOIS — PROPERTY TAX APPEAL STATUTES

<a name="16-55"></a>
## 14. 35 ILCS 200/16-55 — Complaints to Board of Review

### Key Operative Language

**(a)** On written complaint that any property is **overassessed or underassessed**, the board shall **review the assessment, and correct it, as appears to be just**, but in no case shall the property be assessed at a **higher percentage of fair cash value** than other property in the assessment district prior to equalization by the board or the Department.

**(b)** The board shall include **compulsory sales** in reviewing/correcting assessments, including those submitted by the complainant, if the board determines they reflect the same property characteristics and condition.

**(c)** If filed by an attorney, all notices go to the attorney. Attorney must provide proof of authority.

**(d)** A complaint to affect the **current year** assessment must be filed **on or before 30 calendar days** after the date of publication of the assessment list under §12-10. If the complaint doesn't comply with BOR rules, the board must provide **not less than 10 business days** to bring it into compliance.

**(e)** The board may also **at any time before revision is completed, increase, reduce, or otherwise adjust** the assessment, with full power over assessment — BUT property **shall not be assessed at a higher percentage of fair cash value** than other property in the assessment district.

**(f)** **No assessment shall be increased until the person has been notified and given an opportunity to be heard.**

**(h)** All complaints must be **in writing** and filed with the BOR in the required number of copies.

**(i)** For changes of **$100,000 or more** in assessed valuation, the BOR must serve a copy on all taxing districts at least **14 days** prior to hearing. Taxing districts have opportunity to be heard and may intervene.

**(i-5)** If BOR rules require advance evidence submission, the **assessor's evidence** must be submitted to the BOR and complainant **no later than 5 calendar days** prior to hearing.

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- **§16-55(a)** is the core right to appeal — property can't be assessed at a higher % than others
- The **uniformity principle** is the Illinois equivalent of Texas's unequal appraisal
- For residential appeals in Cook County, the filing window is tied to when the township opens/closes for appeals

### What to Cite
- **35 ILCS 200/16-55(a)** — right to complaint, uniformity standard
- **35 ILCS 200/16-55(d)** — 30-day filing deadline

## 15. 35 ILCS 200/16-70 — Determination of Exemptions (Board of Review Powers)

### Key Operative Language
The board of review shall hear and determine the application of any person who is assessed on property claimed to be **exempt from taxation**. The decision of the board shall not be final, except as to homestead exemptions and exemptions under §15-5(b).

For exemptions reducing assessed valuation by **more than $100,000**, the owner must deliver a copy of the application to relevant taxing districts.

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- This section is primarily about **exemptions** (not value protests)
- Our current citation of §16-70 may be **misplaced** — for value appeals, we should cite **§16-55** instead
- §16-70 is relevant only if we're helping users apply for exemptions

### ⚠️ Citation Correction Needed
Our PDFs currently cite **35 ILCS 200/16-70** — this is the exemption section, not the value appeal section. For value appeals/complaints about overassessment, the correct citation is **35 ILCS 200/16-55**.

## 17. Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) — Appeal Process

### Legal Basis
The CCAO appeal is an **administrative appeal** that occurs BEFORE the Board of Review appeal. It is authorized by the Assessor's own rules and procedures, not directly by statute (the statute authorizes the Assessor to make assessments under Article 9 of the Property Tax Code).

### Key Features
- **First level of appeal** — file with the Assessor's Office BEFORE BOR
- Filed during the **appeal period** for your township (published by CCAO)
- Can be filed **online** at cookcountyassessoril.gov
- Evidence: comparable sales, property condition issues, recent appraisals
- **No cost** to file
- The Assessor may **reduce** the assessment — if not satisfied, you then file with the BOR
- Filing with CCAO does NOT affect your right to file with the BOR

### Two-Level Appeal Strategy (Illinois)
1. **CCAO Appeal** → First opportunity for reduction
2. **Board of Review Appeal** → Second opportunity, independent review
3. **PTAB Appeal** → Third opportunity, state-level review (or circuit court)

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- We should instruct users to file with **CCAO first**, then BOR
- Two bites at the apple = higher success rate
- The CCAO appeal is simpler and often results in reductions

## 18. Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB)

### Legal Basis: 35 ILCS 200/16-160 through 16-195

### §16-160 — Appeal Process
- Any taxpayer dissatisfied with the BOR decision may appeal to the PTAB
- In Cook County (3M+ population): within **30 days after** the date of the BOR notice OR 30 days after the BOR transmits its final action on the township to the county assessor, **whichever is later**
- Filing a PTAB petition **precludes filing valuation objections** under §21-175 and §23-5

### §16-170 — Hearings
- A hearing shall be granted if any party requests
- Hearings open to the public
- Board may require production of books, records, papers, documents

### §16-180 — Procedure for Determination
- Board shall establish **informal procedure** for determination of correct assessment
- Procedure shall **eliminate formal rules of pleading, practice, and evidence** to the extent practicable
- Filing fee may be charged
- **All appeals are considered DE NOVO** — PTAB is NOT limited to evidence presented to the BOR
- Parties may introduce evidence not previously introduced at BOR
- Where no BOR complaint was filed and appeal is based solely on equalization factor effect, PTAB **cannot grant reduction greater than** the amount added by the equalization factor

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- PTAB is the **state-level appeal** after BOR — third level of review
- De novo review means you can present **new evidence** not shown to BOR
- Informal procedures make it more accessible for pro se homeowners
- This is the ultimate administrative remedy before court

### What to Cite
- **35 ILCS 200/16-160** — right to appeal to PTAB
- **35 ILCS 200/16-180** — de novo review, informal procedures

## 19. Assessment Ratios & Classification

### Illinois General Rule — 35 ILCS 200/9-145
**All property** (except in counties that classify) shall be valued at **33 1/3% of its fair cash value**.

### Cook County Classification — 35 ILCS 200/9-150 + Cook County Ordinance
Cook County is the **only county in Illinois** that classifies property for different assessment levels, authorized by Article IX, Section 4 of the Illinois Constitution and §9-150.

### Cook County Assessment Levels (Current)

| Class | Description | Assessment Level |
|---|---|---|
| **Class 2** | **Residential** (single-family, 2-6 unit) | **10%** |
| Class 3 | Residential rental (7+ units) | **10%** |
| Class 5a | Commercial | **25%** |
| Class 5b | Industrial | **25%** |
| Various incentive classes | | Varies (10-25%) |

**Source:** Cook County Real Estate Classification Ordinance; CCAO class code definitions.

### Assessment Calculation Example (Cook County Residential)
| Step | Calculation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Fair Market Value | | $400,000 |
| Assessment Level (Class 2) | × 10% | $40,000 |
| State Equalization Factor | × ~2.916 (varies by year) | $116,640 |
| = Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) | | $116,640 |
| Minus Homeowner Exemption | - $10,000 | $106,640 |
| × Tax Rate | × ~8% (varies) | **$8,531** |

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- In Cook County, residential properties are assessed at **10%** of fair market value
- The argument for reduction is: "the fair market value used to compute my assessment is too high"
- When we say "assessed value is $40,000" for a $400K home, we need to explain the 10% ratio
- **Outside Cook County**, all IL property is assessed at 33.33% — different math

### What to Cite
- **35 ILCS 200/9-145** — statutory assessment level (33 1/3%)
- **35 ILCS 200/9-150** — authority for county classification
- Cook County Real Estate Classification Ordinance — 10% residential level

## 20. Equalization Factor (State Multiplier)

### How It Works
The Illinois Department of Revenue annually calculates a **state equalization factor** ("multiplier") for each county. This factor is applied to assessed values to bring the county's overall assessment level to 33 1/3% of fair market value.

For Cook County:
- Because residential is assessed at 10%, the multiplier is typically around **2.9-3.0**
- The multiplier × assessed value = **Equalized Assessed Value (EAV)**
- EAV is the base for tax calculation after exemptions

### Legal Basis
- 35 ILCS 200/17-5 through 17-30 — Department of Revenue equalization process
- The Department certifies the equalization factor annually
- Cannot be appealed directly by individual property owners at BOR (only the underlying assessment can be appealed)

### How This Applies to Overtaxed
- The equalization factor is applied **automatically** — homeowners can't change it
- What CAN be changed through appeal is the **assessed value** (the pre-multiplier number)
- Lowering the assessed value has a multiplied effect because the equalization factor amplifies it
- Example: reducing assessment by $5,000 × 2.916 equalization factor = $14,580 reduction in EAV

# PART 3: CITATION VERIFICATION

### Current PDF Citations

| Citation | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **§41.41(a)(2)** | ✅ **CORRECT** | Right to protest unequal appraisal |
| **§42.26(a)** | ✅ **CORRECT** | Unequal appraisal relief standard |
| **35 ILCS 200/16-70** | ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** | This is the **exemption** section, not value appeals. Should cite **35 ILCS 200/16-55** for value/assessment complaints |

### Recommended Corrections
1. Change **35 ILCS 200/16-70** → **35 ILCS 200/16-55** for Illinois value appeal citations
2. Keep §41.41(a)(2) and §42.26(a) as-is

# PART 5: RELEVANT CASE LAW

### Texas

**1. Aldine Independent School District v. Baty, 999 S.W.2d 113 (Tex. App. — Houston [14th Dist.] 1999)**
- Taxpayer who did not protest to the ARB could not raise appraisal/ownership issues in a delinquent tax lawsuit
- **Lesson:** Must exhaust administrative remedies (protest to ARB) before court

**2. Harris County Appraisal District v. United Investors Realty Trust, 47 S.W.3d 648 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001)**
- Addressed the standard for "similarly situated" properties in unequal appraisal claims
- **Lesson:** Comparable properties should be genuinely similar, not cherry-picked

**3. Texas Supreme Court — No. 22-0620 (2024)**
- Clarified that it is the **ARB order** (not the protest itself) that is the subject of appeal
- **Lesson:** The ARB's written order is the operative document for further appeals

### Illinois

**1. In re Yamaguchi, 118 Ill. 2d 417 (1987)**
- Referenced in Cook County BOR Rule 1 — non-attorneys may not represent taxpayers before the Board
- **Lesson:** Unauthorized practice of law restrictions apply

**2. Walsh v. Property Tax Appeal Board, 181 Ill. 2d 228 (1998)**
- Established that the "uniformity clause" of the Illinois Constitution requires that property be assessed uniformly
- **Lesson:** The uniformity argument is constitutionally grounded

### Key Principle
Both Texas and Illinois courts consistently hold that the **uniformity/equity** argument is a powerful tool for property tax reduction, separate from and in addition to the market value argument.
