## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity
Texas property tax protests have an **~85-90% success rate** when evidence is properly presented. Between 30-60% of residential properties are overassessed by county appraisal districts that rely on Computer-Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) systems. Yet fewer than 25% of homeowners file protests, and fewer than 5% nationally do so. This represents a massive, underserved market.

### What Wins Protests
After exhaustive research across all 10 counties, the evidence is clear:

1. **Equity comp grids** (uniform & equal argument under §42.26) are the single most powerful tool for residential protests. This compares the subject property's $/sqft appraised value to the median of 5-10 similar properties on the same tax roll, appropriately adjusted.

2. **Sales comp analysis** (market value argument under §41.43) using 3-5 recent arms-length sales within 0.5-1 mile, adjusted for differences.

3. **Property condition documentation** — photos of deferred maintenance, repair estimates, functional/external obsolescence.

4. **Record error corrections** — wrong square footage, bed/bath count, quality/condition codes.

### What a $49 Package Must Include to Compete
Based on our analysis of professional firms (Ownwell, O'Connor/CutMyTaxes, Texas Protax, NTPTS, Home Tax Shield) and direct competitors (AppealDesk at $49, SquareDeal at ~$30-50/report, TaxLasso at $0 filing fee), a competitive $49 package needs:

| Component | Must Have | Nice to Have |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Equity comp grid (5-10 comps, adjusted) | ✅ CRITICAL | — |
| Sales comp analysis (3-5 comps) | ✅ CRITICAL | — |
| Property record audit (sqft, beds, baths) | ✅ CRITICAL | — |
| County-specific filing instructions | ✅ CRITICAL | — |
| Pre-written protest letter / cover sheet | ✅ | — |
| $/sqft analysis with median calculation | ✅ | — |
| Opinion of value recommendation | ✅ | — |
| Neighborhood map showing comp locations | — | ✅ |
| CAD evidence packet rebuttal tips | — | ✅ |
| Photo/repair estimate submission guide | — | ✅ |
| Hearing preparation checklist | — | ✅ |

### Key Finding
**The biggest gap in the market is not the $49 evidence package — AppealDesk already exists there. The gap is county-specific, Texas-optimized evidence packages that leverage BOTH the equity AND market value arguments simultaneously, formatted specifically for each county's portal requirements.** Most $49 competitors are national and generic. Overtaxed can win by being hyper-local to these 10 Texas counties.

## How Texas Property Tax Protests Work

### The Three-Phase Process

**Phase 1: File Your Protest**
- Deadline: May 15 or 30 days after notice mailed, whichever is later
- File Form 50-132 (Notice of Protest) or use county's online portal
- Check BOTH boxes: "Value is over market value" AND "Value is unequal compared with other properties"
- Submit your opinion of value (the number you believe is correct)

**Phase 2: Informal Hearing/Settlement**
- After filing, most counties offer an informal review with an appraiser
- Some counties (Harris) use automated settlement systems (iSettle)
- This is where ~60-70% of protests are resolved
- The appraiser reviews your evidence and may offer a settlement
- If you accept, the protest ends at the new agreed value
- **Critical**: Evidence submitted BEFORE the informal hearing is key

**Phase 3: Formal ARB Hearing**
- If informal doesn't resolve, you go before a 3-member Appraisal Review Board panel
- Hearings typically last 15-20 minutes (some counties limit to 15 min)
- You present evidence first, then the CAD appraiser responds
- Bring 4-5 copies of all evidence (one per ARB member + appraiser + yourself)
- The ARB issues a binding decision for that tax year
- Can be attended in person, by phone, or video conference

### Key Legal Protections
- **Your value CANNOT be raised** as a result of protesting (Texas Tax Code)
- **Burden of proof is on the CAD** if you submit an independent appraisal before the hearing
- You can protest every year, regardless of whether value went up
- Filing a protest costs nothing — it's a constitutional right

---

## The Two Legal Grounds That Win

### Ground 1: Market Value (§41.43)
**What it is**: Your property's appraised value exceeds what it would sell for on the open market as of January 1.

**Evidence needed**:
- 3-5 recent arms-length sales of comparable properties
- Sales should be within 6-12 months of January 1 valuation date
- Properties within 0.5-1 mile radius, same neighborhood/school district preferred
- Similar in: square footage (±20%), year built (±10 years), beds/baths, lot size, quality/condition
- **Adjustments required**: Adjust each comp for differences from subject property
  - Price per sqft × difference in sqft
  - Pool/no pool adjustment ($15-25K typical)
  - Garage/carport differences
  - Condition adjustments (e.g., updated kitchen = +$10-20K)
  - Lot size adjustments

**Format**: Table with columns for:
| Field | Required |
|-------|----------|
| Property address | ✅ |
| Account number | ✅ (for Texas) |
| Sale price | ✅ |
| Sale date | ✅ |
| Living area (sqft) | ✅ |
| Year built | ✅ |
| Beds/Baths | ✅ |
| Lot size | Recommended |
| Pool Y/N | Recommended |
| Garage | Recommended |
| Adjusted value | ✅ |
| $/sqft | ✅ |

**Challenge in Texas**: Texas is a **non-disclosure state** — sale prices are not public record. MLS data requires a real estate agent. However:
- County CADs DO collect sales data (confidential surveys)
- CADs share their sales comps in the evidence packet they provide 14 days before hearing
- Homeowners can ask a realtor for a CMA (comparative market analysis)
- Some data is available through listing prices on Zillow/Redfin (though list price ≠ sale price)

### Ground 2: Uniform & Equal / Unequal Appraisal (§42.26)
**What it is**: Your property is appraised higher per square foot than comparable properties currently on the tax roll — even if the market value might be accurate.

**This is the MORE POWERFUL argument for most Texas residential protests because**:
- Uses publicly available CAD data (appraised values are public, unlike sales)
- Doesn't require access to MLS/sales data
- The equity argument can reduce value even when market values are rising
- Texas Tax Code §42.26 specifically provides this remedy

**Evidence needed**:
- 5-10 comparable properties from the same tax roll
- Must be "appropriately adjusted" for differences
- Calculate the MEDIAN adjusted appraised value of the comps
- If your appraised value exceeds this median, you're entitled to relief
- The 10% threshold: If your appraisal ratio exceeds the median by at least 10%, relief is mandatory

**Format — The Comp Equity Grid**:
This is the standard format that CADs, ARBs, and professional firms all use:

```
SUBJECT PROPERTY: [Address] | Account: [#] | Appraised Value: $XXX,XXX | Sqft: X,XXX | $/sqft: $XXX

COMPARABLE PROPERTIES:
| # | Address | Acct # | Appraised Value | Sqft | $/sqft | Year Built | Beds | Baths | Adjustments | Adj Value |
|---|---------|--------|----------------|------|--------|------------|------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | ...     | ...    | $XXX,XXX       | X,XXX| $XXX   | XXXX       | X    | X     | +/- $XX,XXX | $XXX,XXX  |
| 2 | ...     | ...    | ...            | ...  | ...    | ...        | ...  | ...   | ...         | ...       |
...

MEDIAN ADJUSTED VALUE: $XXX,XXX
SUBJECT APPRAISED VALUE: $XXX,XXX
DIFFERENCE: $XX,XXX (XX%)
RECOMMENDED OPINION OF VALUE: $XXX,XXX
```

**Key adjustment factors**:
- Size ($/sqft × difference in sqft)
- Age (newer = higher, older = lower)
- Quality/grade (from CAD records)
- Condition (from CAD records)
- Pool, garage, extra features
- Lot size (if significantly different)

### Dual Argument Strategy (Best Practice)
**Always file on BOTH grounds**. Texas Tax Code requires the value to be set at the LOWEST value indicated by any ground. Professional firms always present both arguments. Your package should support both.

---

## Evidence Format Best Practices

### What ARBs Want to See

Based on research across all 10 counties and professional firm standards:

1. **One-Page Summary / Cover Sheet**
   - Property address and account number
   - Current appraised value
   - Your opinion of value (the number you want)
   - Brief statement of grounds (market value + unequal appraisal)
   - List of attached evidence

2. **Equity Comp Grid** (1-2 pages)
   - 5-10 comparable properties from the CAD database
   - All adjustments shown with math
   - Median calculation clearly shown
   - Subject property highlighted or in separate column

3. **Sales Comp Analysis** (1-2 pages)
   - 3-5 recent sales with adjusted values
   - Map showing locations relative to subject
   - Source of sales data cited

4. **Property Condition Evidence** (if applicable)
   - Timestamped photos
   - Contractor repair estimates on letterhead
   - Description of deferred maintenance

5. **Property Record Corrections** (if applicable)
   - Printout from CAD showing errors
   - Correct information with supporting docs
   - Highlight specific errors (sqft, bed/bath, etc.)

### Format Requirements
- **PDF is universal** — all county portals accept PDF uploads
- Most portals also accept JPG/PNG for photos
- Bring **4-5 printed copies** to formal ARB hearings
- Keep total package concise: **8-12 pages max** for residential
- Number all pages for reference during hearing
- Use tables and charts — ARB members see dozens of cases per day

### Common Mistakes That Get Protests Denied
1. **No evidence at all** — just saying "it's too high" without proof
2. **Emotional arguments** — "I can't afford this" or "taxes are unfair" (ARB only sets value, not rates)
3. **Using Zillow estimates** as evidence (not accepted as reliable)
4. **Wrong comps** — using properties too dissimilar (different neighborhood, size, age)
5. **No adjustments** — presenting raw comps without adjusting for differences
6. **Missing deadline** — after May 15, you're locked out for the year
7. **Not checking both protest boxes** — filing only on market value misses the equity argument
8. **Discussing tax rates or tax amounts** — ARB only controls value, not rates

## Gap Analysis

### What a $49 Overtaxed Package Needs to Beat the Competition

#### Vs. Professional Firms ($150-$500+ / 25-40% contingency)

| What Pros Have | What Overtaxed Can Offer | Gap? |
|----------------|-------------------------|------|
| MLS sales data access | Public data + CAD records + listing data | MODERATE — can't match MLS without agent license |
| Licensed hearing representatives | Self-representation guide + coaching | YES — but most protests resolve before hearing |
| Proprietary databases | CAD public data + data aggregation | MODERATE |
| Experience with specific ARB panels | County-specific hearing tips & procedures | CAN CLOSE with research |
| Multiple hearing attempts (informal + ARB + arbitration) | Guide through full process | CAN CLOSE with documentation |
| Condition documentation by inspectors | Template + photo guide for homeowner | CAN CLOSE |
| Custom software analysis | Automated analysis of CAD data | CAN MATCH with engineering |

**Critical insight**: Professional firms' biggest advantage is **not** better evidence — it's **convenience and hearing representation**. For a $49 package, you can absolutely provide evidence that's 80-90% as good as what a $300 firm submits. The homeowner just needs to present it themselves.

#### Vs. AppealDesk ($49)

| What AppealDesk Has | What Overtaxed Should Add |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Comparable sales analysis | ✅ MATCH + add equity comp grid (they don't!) |
| County-specific filing guide | ✅ MATCH + go deeper (portal screenshots, step-by-step) |
| Pre-written cover letter | ✅ MATCH |
| National coverage (all 50 states) | 🎯 Texas-only but MUCH deeper |
| No equity argument | 🎯 **THIS IS YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE** |
| No mention of §42.26 | 🎯 Build entire packages around dual argument |
| Generic evidence format | 🎯 County-specific formatting for each portal |

#### Vs. SquareDeal (~$30-50)

| What SquareDeal Has | What Overtaxed Should Add |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Equity comp grids | ✅ MATCH |
| Texas-specific knowledge | ✅ MATCH |
| Education content (blog) | 🎯 Can match over time |
| Money-back guarantee | 🎯 Should offer same |
| No sales comp analysis | 🎯 ADD sales comps (they don't!) |
| No filing guide | 🎯 ADD county-specific instructions |
| No cover letter | 🎯 ADD pre-written letter |
| No condition evidence guide | 🎯 ADD photo/repair documentation guide |

### THE WINNING FORMULA FOR OVERTAXED

**Combine the best of both competitors**:
- AppealDesk's polish + filing guide + cover letter

- **Page 4 — Property Record Audit**
  - Side-by-side comparison of CAD records vs. actual property
  - Flag any discrepancies in sqft, beds, baths, year built, quality, condition, extra features
  - Calculated impact of errors on value

#### Deliverable 2: County Filing Guide (PDF, 2-3 pages)

- Key dates and deadlines

#### Deliverable 3: Protest Letter / Cover Sheet (PDF, 1 page)
- Pre-filled with property details and opinion of value
- Professional formatting
- References attached evidence by page number
- Ready to upload to portal or hand to ARB members

#### Deliverable 4: Hearing Preparation Guide (PDF, 1-2 pages)

### Pricing & Guarantee
- **$49 flat fee** — keep 100% of savings
- **Money-back guarantee**: If you don't get a reduction, full refund
- Position against: "Tax firms charge $300-500+ or take 25-40% of your savings every year. On a $2,000 annual savings, that's $500-$800 PER YEAR to a firm. Overtaxed is $49 once."

### Technical Requirements for Building the Product

**Data Sources Needed**:
1. County CAD public records (appraised values, property characteristics) — all available online through each county's property search
2. Listing/sales data — partner with a licensed agent or use available aggregators
3. Property record details — from CAD databases

**Per-County Customization**:
- Portal-specific filing instructions
- Different evidence packet request processes (e.g., FBCAD requires separate request)
- Different settlement systems (Harris uses iSettle, others use informal meetings)
- Different hearing copy requirements (Travis wants 5 copies, others 4)

**Automation Opportunity**:
- Enter address → pull property data from CAD
- Auto-select comparable properties using criteria (location, size, age, type)
- Auto-calculate adjustments and median values
- Generate all 4 deliverables as customized PDFs
- County-specific filing guide auto-selected

### Marketing Positioning

**Core message**: "Your county already has the data that proves you're overpaying. We just organize it into a winning evidence package."

**Key differentiators vs. competition**:
1. **Texas-only, hyper-local** — not a generic national tool
2. **Dual argument** (equity + market) — most DIY tools only do one
3. **County-specific filing guides** — screenshots and step-by-step for all 10 counties
4. **$49 flat fee, keep 100%** — vs. 25-40% contingency firms taking hundreds annually
5. **Money-back guarantee** — confidence in the evidence

**Target customer profile**:
- Texas homeowner in one of 10 served counties
- Received appraisal notice showing increase
- Doesn't want to pay $300-800/year to a firm
- Doesn't have time to research comps and build evidence themselves
- Wants to DIY the filing/hearing but needs the evidence prepared

## Data Requirements Per County

### Universal Data Fields (All Counties)
For every property and comparable, the following data points are needed:

| Data Field | Source | Importance |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Property address | CAD public records | Required |
| Account number | CAD public records | Required |
| Market/appraised value | CAD public records | Required |
| Living area (sqft) | CAD public records | Required |
| Price per square foot | Calculated | Required |
| Year built | CAD public records | Required |
| Bedrooms | CAD public records | Required |
| Bathrooms | CAD public records | Required |
| Lot size | CAD public records | Recommended |
| Quality/grade/class | CAD public records | Important for adjustments |
| Condition | CAD public records | Important for adjustments |
| Pool | CAD public records | Adjustment factor |
| Garage type/size | CAD public records | Adjustment factor |
| Extra features (porch, fireplace, etc.) | CAD public records | Adjustment factor |
| Construction type | CAD public records | Important for comp selection |
| Homestead exemption status | CAD public records | Affects cap calculations |

### Is $/sqft Enough?
**No, but it's the foundation.** The raw $/sqft comparison gets you 70% of the way there. But to survive scrutiny at an ARB hearing (and to match what professional firms submit), you need adjustments for:
- Size differences (larger homes generally have lower $/sqft)
- Age differences
- Quality/condition differences
- Feature differences (pool, garage, etc.)

Professional firms make these adjustments. Your $49 package should too.

### Do You Need Photos?
**Not in the evidence package — but guide the homeowner to take them.** Photos of property condition issues (deferred maintenance, damage, outdated features) are submitted BY THE HOMEOWNER as supplementary evidence. Your package should:
1. Audit the CAD's condition rating vs. likely reality
2. Provide a "Photo Guide" telling homeowner exactly what to photograph
3. Explain how to get repair estimates
4. Show where/how to upload photos to their county's portal

### Do You Need Sales Data?
**Ideally yes, but equity comps alone can win.** Due to Texas's non-disclosure law, getting actual sale prices is harder than in other states. Options:
1. CAD's own sales data (available in some evidence packets)
2. Partnership with a licensed real estate agent
3. Listing price data from public sources (weaker but usable)
4. The homeowner's own purchase price (if recent)

**Recommendation**: Build the package primarily around equity comps (publicly available CAD data), but include sales analysis where data is available. The equity argument is actually STRONGER in Texas because it sidesteps the non-disclosure issue entirely.

| Home Tax Shield | Contingency | Contingency | ✅ Texas | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ Full |

**Overtaxed's position**: Best value in Texas for a self-file evidence package. More comprehensive than AppealDesk (which is national/generic) and more complete than SquareDeal (which only does equity comps). Fraction of the cost of contingency firms.
