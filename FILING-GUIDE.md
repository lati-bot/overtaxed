# Cook County Property Tax Appeal — Complete Filing Guide

This document captures the full end-to-end filing process for both filing bodies, researched by walking through the actual portals and reading all official documentation. This knowledge powers the filing instructions in our appeal packages.

---

## Overview: Three Filing Bodies

Cook County property owners have **three levels of appeal** (sequential):

1. **Cook County Assessor's Office** — First level, during reassessment
2. **Cook County Board of Review (BOR)** — Second level, after Assessor closes
3. **Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB)** — State level, after BOR decision

### The Two-Bite Strategy (What Attorneys Do)
File with Assessor FIRST → then file again with Board of Review. Two separate chances at a reduction. Most professional tax appeal firms file with both.

---

## Filing Body #1: Cook County Assessor's Office (SmartFile)

### Portal URL
`https://propertytaxfilings.cookcountyil.gov`

### Account Required: YES
- Registration: email + password (8-character minimum, case-sensitive)
- **Email verification required** — activation link sent to email
- Only 2 fields: email and password (no name, phone, etc.)
- Forgot password flow available
- Built by Tyler Technologies

### SmartFile Form Structure (From Live Portal Exploration)
- PIN search: "No dashes or spaces" text field + "Parcel Street Address" field + Search button
- Results grid: columns = [action button] | PIN | Owner Name | Location Address
- "Start Filing" link in first column → opens the filing form
- Same Tyler Technologies platform pattern across all filing types
- Provides both PIN and address search (mirrors our Overtaxed search)

### When Can You File? (Assessor)
- Townships rotate on a triennial (3-year) schedule
- Filing windows are typically ~30 days
- Calendar: `cookcountyassessoril.gov/assessment-calendar-and-deadlines`

### Appeal Types Available
- Lack of Uniformity (primary — this is what we use)
- Recent Purchase
- Market Value
- Factual Error
- Special Circumstances

### SmartFile Process (After Login)
**Note: The appeal filing type ONLY appears when your township is open for reassessment.** When no townships are open, SmartFile only shows exemptions, permits, and property characteristics filings. Confirmed by logging in Feb 2026 — no appeal option visible.

When open:
1. Go to `cookcountyassessor.com/Search/Property-Search.aspx`
2. Search for your property → click "Appeals"
3. If township is open, the appeal form appears
4. Select appeal reason: **"Lack of Uniformity"**
5. **Key insight**: You do NOT need to provide comps — CCAO analysts will find and analyze comparable properties themselves
6. However, you CAN attach up to **6 comparable PINs** as supporting evidence
7. Upload supporting documents (our PDF appeal package)
8. Submit

Alternative: Via SmartFile portal directly after login → "Available Filings" → appeal filing type (when visible)

### Attaching Comparable Properties (SmartFile)
From official CCAO documentation:
- Maximum **6 comparable PINs**
- **Specific file naming convention required:**
  - Individual PDFs: `Comparable PIN XX-XX-XXX-XXX-XXXX.pdf`
  - OR one Excel file: `Comparable PINs for XX-XX-XXX-XXX-XXXX.xlsx`
- Attach in the "Attachments" tab under comparable PINs section
- Step-by-step PDF guide: `prodassets.cookcountyassessoril.gov/s3fs-public/form_documents/CookViewerComparableInstructions.pdf`

### Cook Viewer Tool
- URL: `maps.cookcountyil.gov/cookviewer/`
- Auto-filters comps by neighborhood, class, sqft, age
- Can export up to 6 comparable PINs as Excel
- This is what the Assessor recommends homeowners use

### Photo Requirement (Assessor)
- **NOT required for individual homeowners filing their own appeal**
- Required when attorney or service files on behalf

### Alternative Filing Method
Email: `assessor.onlineappeals@cookcountyil.gov`
Subject: "Assessment Appeal" + Township Name + PIN
Attach supporting documents

### Official Appeal Forms (Downloadable PDFs)
- **Residential Appeal Form**: `prodassets.cookcountyassessoril.gov/s3fs-public/form_documents/resappeal.pdf`
- **Condo Appeal Form**: `prodassets.cookcountyassessoril.gov/s3fs-public/form_documents/condoappeal.pdf`
- **Residential Appeal Filing Guidelines**: `prodassets.cookcountyassessoril.gov/s3fs-public/form_documents/ResidentialAppealFiling.pdf`
- **Condo Filing Guidelines**: `prodassets.cookcountyassessoril.gov/s3fs-public/form_documents/condominiumfiling.pdf`
- **General Affidavit** (for representative filings): `prodassets.cookcountyassessoril.gov/s3fs-public/form_documents/Generalaff.pdf`
- **Vacant Land Appeal**: `prodassets.cookcountyassessoril.gov/s3fs-public/form_documents/vaclndappeal.pdf`

### Three Grounds for Assessor Appeal
1. **Uniformity** — Your assessment per sqft is higher than similar homes (this is what we use)
2. **Overvaluation** — You believe the estimated property value is too high (submit closing statements, recent sales)
3. **Property Description Error** — Incorrect sqft, wrong characteristics, etc.

### Key Assessor Policy Points
- Class 2 = assessed at **10% of estimated property value**
- Example: $100K value → $10K assessed valuation
- Assessor does NOT calculate taxes — local governments (municipalities, school districts) do
- You do NOT need a lawyer, tax rep, or appraiser to file
- If a representative files, need notarized "Owner/Lessee Verification Form"
- You get ~30 days after receiving "Notice of Proposed Assessed Valuation"
- Can also appeal between reassessments (any year)

### Evidence Guidelines for Uniformity (BOR)
From official "How to Present a Case Based on Lack of Uniformity":

**Comparable properties must be:**
- Preferably on your own block; may be a block or two away
- **Must be within your neighborhood**
- Similar in: size, type of construction, age, construction materials, general condition
- **Same property class** (e.g., if you're 2-03, comps should be 2-03)

**You should have 3-5 similar properties**

**Documentation should include:**
- Addresses of comparable properties
- Permanent Index Numbers (PINs)
- Assessed values (land + improvement breakdown + total)
- **Photos of front of your property** — REQUIRED (BOR Rule #17)
- Photos of comparable properties — "very helpful"
- Assessment per square foot calculation:
  `Building Assessment ÷ Building Square Footage = $/sqft`

### Photo Requirement (BOR)
- **Photos of the SUBJECT property ARE REQUIRED** for BOR appeals
- "Since it would be impossible for the Board's decision-makers to visit each appealed property, these pictures can help prove your case"
- Photos of comparable properties are "very helpful" but not required
- Per BOR Rule #17

### Who Can Represent
- **Individual taxpayers**: Can represent themselves (pro se)
- **Corporation/LLC-owned properties**: MUST have an attorney
- **Consultants**: May NOT represent homeowners at BOR

### Contact Information
- Main office: 118 N. Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60602
- Phone: 312-603-5542
- Fax: 312-603-3479
- Email: `ccbor.onlineform@cookcountyil.gov`

## Implications for Overtaxed Appeal Packages

### Assessor Package (SmartFile-Optimized)
- **6 comps max** (not 9) — select the 6 strongest
- **File naming**: Generate individual comp PDFs with correct naming convention OR single Excel export
- **No photo needed** for homeowner-filed appeals
- Focus on making comps easy to copy-paste into SmartFile
- Include clear list of 6 comp PINs for data entry
- Our PDF serves as supporting evidence attachment
- Emphasize: "The Assessor's analysts will also review your case independently"

### Board of Review Package (Full Attorney-Grade)
- **All 9 comps** — more evidence = stronger case
- **MUST include photo** of subject property front
- **Include photos of comps** if possible (Google Street View?)
- Written uniformity brief — the notes area accepts narrative
- Full assessment breakdown (building + land + total)
- Assessment per sqft calculation prominently displayed
- 5-year assessment history
- Contact info form fields listed for easy reference
- Hearing recommendation guidance

### Both Packages Should Include
- Township name and filing window dates (dynamically)
- Step-by-step filing instructions specific to each body
- PIN in copy-paste-ready format
- Clear "what to do next" section

## User Experience Pain Points to Address

1. **SmartFile email verification** — potential drop-off for older users
2. **Finding your PIN** — many people don't know it (we solve this with address search)
3. **CAPTCHA** — frustrating for some users, especially on mobile
4. **Township timing** — confusing which body is open when (we auto-detect this)
5. **"Am I an attorney?"** — confusing question for regular homeowners
6. **LLC ownership** — many investment properties in LLCs, those MUST have attorney at BOR
7. **File naming convention** — easy to mess up for SmartFile
8. **What document type to select** — we should tell them exactly
