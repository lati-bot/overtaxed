## Content Gaps & Opportunities

### High-Value Gaps (Bad/No Good Answers Exist)
1. **"How to protest property taxes yourself step-by-step (with screenshots)"** — Most guides are text-heavy walls. A visual, screenshot-based walkthrough of iFile, iSettle, and online filing for each major county would dominate.

2. **"Property tax protest calculator — how much will I save?"** — People search this but Texas law prohibits protest companies from giving estimates. An interactive calculator that shows *potential* savings based on tax rate × reduction would be hugely valuable. (Competitors note they legally can't estimate, creating a gap.)

3. **"What to say at your property tax hearing"** — Lots of "what evidence to bring" content, but almost nothing on the actual *script* or *talking points* for the hearing itself.

4. **"Property tax protest for new homeowners / first-time buyers"** — Tons of Reddit questions from confused first-time buyers. No dedicated guide exists targeting this persona.

5. **"Should I protest if my value went DOWN?"** — Only cutmytaxes.com addresses this. Huge opportunity since values are flat/declining in some TX markets.

6. **"Property tax protest results by county"** — No one publishes success rates or average reductions by county in an accessible format.

7. **"Uniform and equal explained simply"** — This is a powerful protest strategy but all content is legal-jargon heavy. A plain-English explainer with examples would rank.

8. **"How to read your appraisal notice"** — Houston Chronicle did this but it's paywalled. Free, visual content would rank.

9. **"Property tax protest for rental/investment properties"** — Almost all content targets primary homeowners. Investors are underserved.

10. **"What happens AFTER you win your protest"** — Nobody explains how the reduction flows through to your actual tax bill, escrow adjustment, etc.

## FAQ Entries for Landing Pages

### General FAQ
**Q: How do I protest my property taxes in Texas?**
A: File a Notice of Protest (Form 50-132) with your county's appraisal district by May 15 or within 30 days of receiving your appraisal notice. You can file online, by mail, or in person.

**Q: Is it worth protesting property taxes?**
A: Yes. About 65% of Texas property owners who protest receive a reduction. Even if your value didn't increase, you may be over-assessed compared to neighbors. There are zero drawbacks — your value cannot be raised as a result of a protest.

**Q: What is the deadline to protest property taxes in Texas?**
A: May 15, 2026, or 30 days after the date your appraisal notice was mailed — whichever is later.

**Q: How much can I save by protesting property taxes?**
A: Savings vary, but the average Texas homeowner saves $500–$1,500 per year. A $50,000 reduction in appraised value saves roughly $815 annually at typical Texas tax rates.

**Q: What evidence do I need for a property tax protest?**
A: The strongest evidence includes: comparable sales (recent sales of similar homes), comparable assessments (showing neighbors are assessed lower per sq ft), photos of property condition issues, repair estimates, and any errors in your property record (wrong square footage, room count, etc.).

**Q: Can I protest property taxes myself or do I need a company?**
A: You can absolutely do it yourself. In Harris County, 82% of DIY protests were successful vs 53% for agent-led protests (per HCAD data). However, companies save you time and may achieve larger reductions through expertise and volume leverage.

**Q: What do property tax protest companies charge?**
A: Most charge on a contingency basis — typically 25-50% of first-year tax savings. Some charge a small flat fee plus a percentage. If they don't save you money, you don't pay.

**Q: What is the uniform and equal argument?**
A: Texas law requires property values to be "equal and uniform." If your home is assessed higher per square foot than comparable homes in your area, you can argue your value should be reduced to the median. This is often the strongest basis for a protest.

**Q: Can my property value be raised if I protest?**
A: No. Texas law prevents the appraisal district from raising your value as a result of a protest. There is no risk to filing.

**Q: What happens at a property tax hearing?**
A: First, you'll have an informal hearing where you meet one-on-one with an appraiser to discuss your evidence. If you can't reach an agreement, you proceed to a formal hearing before the Appraisal Review Board (ARB), a panel of 3 members who make the final decision.

**Q: Should I protest even if my value didn't increase?**
A: Yes! Even if your value stayed the same, neighboring properties may have decreased, making yours unfairly high by comparison. Protesting also helps keep your capped/appraised value low, which saves money in future years.

## Competitive Intelligence Notes

### What Competitors Do Well
- **O'Connor**: Volume and brand recognition. "$213M saved in 2025" is compelling social proof.
- **Texas Tax Protest**: Strong blog content, case studies, proprietary software messaging
- **SquareDeal Tax**: Good "DIY vs agent" data-driven content. Emerging threat as a DIY platform.
- **Gill Denson**: Excellent "is it worth it" content, 80% success rate messaging
- **Ownwell**: Tech-forward, referral-driven growth (Reddit presence)

### What Competitors Miss
- No one has a truly great interactive tool (calculator, comp finder)
- No one publishes transparent success rate data by county
- Visual/screenshot-based tutorials are nonexistent
- First-time buyer and investor personas are ignored
- Post-protest content (what happens after you win) doesn't exist
- Nobody explains escrow adjustments after a successful protest
- "What to actually say" at hearings — no scripts or templates

### Reddit Signals (What Real People Struggle With)
- Confusion about whether protest can raise value (common fear)
- Not knowing where to find comparable sales data
- Uncertainty about whether to DIY or hire someone
- Questions about what happens to protest evidence (is it public record?)
- Fee structure confusion (% of savings vs % of reduction)
- Frustration with iFile/iSettle process
- New homeowners completely lost on the process
- Questions about protesting values for properties in declining markets

## Cook County (Chicago) — Expansion Opportunity Notes

Cook County property tax appeals are dominated by:
- **Government pages**: cookcountyassessoril.gov, cookcountyboardofreview.com
- **Attorneys**: Elliott Law, Richard Shapiro — attorney-driven market (unlike Texas)
- **Property Tax Solutions** (propertytaxsolutions.com)

Key differences from Texas:
- Two-level appeal: Assessor's Office → Board of Review → PTAB
- Attorney-centric (vs. consultant-centric in Texas)
- Class-based system (residential, commercial, industrial)
- Less DIY-friendly than Texas

**Opportunity**: If expanding beyond Texas, Cook County is the #2 market. Content is poor and dominated by government sites and law firms. A user-friendly guide would stand out.
