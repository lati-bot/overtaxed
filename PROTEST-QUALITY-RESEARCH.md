## Synthesis of TX Protest Audit, Cook County Appeal Audit, and Competitor Teardown
### February 17, 2026 | TX Deadline: May 15, 2026

## Section 1: What Does a World-Class Protest Package Look Like?

Based on research across all 10 TX counties, Cook County IL, 9+ competitors, and actual ARB/BOR evidence standards, the **ideal $49 protest package** would contain:

### The 4-Deliverable Model

**Deliverable 1: Evidence Packet (PDF, 4-6 pages)**
The core product. Must include:

1. **Cover Page / Protest Letter** — Pre-written, professional, references all attached evidence. Includes property details, opinion of value, and the specific legal grounds being argued.

2. **Equity/Uniformity Analysis (§42.26 for TX / 35 ILCS 200/16-70 for IL)**
   - Subject property details (address, account#, appraised value, sqft, $/sqft, key characteristics)
   - 5-10 comparable properties from the SAME tax roll
   - Table format: address, account#, appraised value, sqft, $/sqft, year built, beds/baths (where available), adjustments, adjusted value
   - Median comp $/sqft calculation
   - Clear statement: "Subject is assessed at $X/sqft vs median of $Y/sqft among comparable properties"
   - This is the MOST POWERFUL argument in TX — uses public CAD data, sidesteps non-disclosure

3. **Market Value Analysis (§41.43 for TX)**
   - Where sales data is available: 3-5 recent comparable sales
   - Adjusted sale prices with $/sqft calculations
   - Where sales data is NOT available (most TX counties due to non-disclosure): guide homeowner to request CAD's evidence packet (which contains their sales comps) 14 days before hearing, then use those against them

4. **Property Record Audit**
   - CAD's recorded characteristics vs what we know
   - Flag potential errors (sqft discrepancies, incorrect features)
   - Calculated impact of errors on value
   - Prompt homeowner to verify and photograph any issues

**Deliverable 2: County Filing Guide (PDF, 2-3 pages)**
- County-specific step-by-step portal instructions
- Which boxes to check (ALWAYS check BOTH market value AND unequal appraisal)
- How to enter opinion of value
- Where to upload evidence
- Key deadlines
- How to request the CAD's evidence packet

**Deliverable 3: Hearing Preparation Guide (PDF, 1-2 pages)**
- What to expect at informal hearing vs formal ARB
- 5-minute presentation script ("Here's exactly what to say")
- Common appraiser rebuttals and how to counter them
- What NOT to say (don't discuss tax bill amount, don't get emotional, don't compare to Zillow)
- How to negotiate a settlement at informal
- When to accept vs push to formal ARB

**Deliverable 4: Property Condition Checklist (PDF, 1 page)**
- Photo guide: what to photograph (deferred maintenance, damage, outdated features)
- How to get repair estimates
- Where/how to upload supplementary evidence to portal
- How condition documentation strengthens your case

### What Makes This "Worth Way More Than $49"
- **Dual legal argument** (equity + market value) — most DIY tools only do one
- **Pre-written protest letter** ready to sign
- **Hearing script** — nobody else in the $49 tier provides this
- **County-specific** — not generic national templates
- **Property record audit** — catches CAD errors that can win protests instantly
- **Money-back guarantee** — if no reduction, full refund

### Competitive Position

## Section 2: Per-Market Product Spec

### TEXAS COUNTIES (All share §42.26 / §41.43 framework, May 15 deadline)

#### Universal TX Requirements
- File Form 50-132 (Notice of Protest) or use county online portal
- Check BOTH boxes: "Value is over market value" AND "Value is unequal"
- Submit opinion of value
- Request CAD evidence packet (received ~14 days before hearing)
- Bring 4-5 copies of evidence to hearing (if in person)
- Informal hearing resolves ~60-70% of cases
- Your value CANNOT be raised as result of protesting

---

### Harris County (Houston) — HCAD
**Portal**: iFile (hcad.org) + iSettle automated settlement system
**Data we have**: address, sqft, year built, appraised value, neighborhood, comps ✅
**Data we're missing**: beds/baths ⚠️
**Impact of gap**: MEDIUM — $/sqft is the legal standard for §42.26. Beds/baths strengthen comps but aren't required. Professional firms in Houston file without them.
**County quirks**:
- iSettle: automated system offers settlement BEFORE informal hearing. Evidence must be strong enough to beat the algorithm.
- Largest protest volume in TX (~600K+ protests/year)
- Most experienced appraisers — need tight evidence
**PDF must include**: Equity comp grid ($/sqft), neighborhood analysis, property record audit (sqft verification critical — Deji's winning case was based on sqft error)

---

### Dallas County — DCAD
**Portal**: uFile (dallascad.org)
**Data we have**: address, sqft, beds, baths, year built, appraised value, neighborhood, pool, fireplaces, comps ✅
**Data gaps**: None significant — best data quality of all counties
**County quirks**:
- "uFile" online protest system (NOT "eFile")
- Strong data = strong comps. Can build fully detailed equity grids.
**PDF must include**: Full equity comp grid with all characteristics, condition-adjusted comps

---

### Collin County — CCAD
**Portal**: onlineportal.collincad.org
**Data we have**: address, sqft, beds (84.5%), baths, year built, appraised value, neighborhood, comps ✅
**Data gaps**: 15.5% missing beds data — MEDIUM impact
**County quirks**:
- Online portal (NOT old "eprotest.collincad.org")
- Rapidly growing county — lots of new construction comps available
**PDF must include**: Full equity comp grid, flag properties where beds data is estimated

---

### Tarrant County — TAD
**Portal**: True Prodigy system (tad.org)
**Data we have**: address, sqft, year built, appraised value, quality grade, condition ✅
**Data we're missing**: beds/baths ⚠️ (permanently unavailable — TAD doesn't track)
**Impact of gap**: MEDIUM — quality grade + condition data compensates. Use these for comp adjustments instead of beds/baths.
**County quirks**:
- True Prodigy portal system
- Quality grade + condition are strong adjustment proxies
**PDF must include**: Equity comp grid using sqft + quality/condition adjustments

---

### Denton County — Denton CAD
**Portal**: dentoncad.net
**Data we have**: address, sqft, year built, appraised value, subdivision ✅
**Data we're missing**: beds/baths ⚠️
**Impact of gap**: MEDIUM — same as Tarrant/Harris approach
**County quirks**:
- 10,129 subdivisions as neighborhood proxy — very granular comps
- Fast-growing county (Frisco, Flower Mound)
**PDF must include**: Equity comp grid, subdivision-based analysis

---

### Rockwall County — RCAD
**Portal**: rockwallcad.com (True Prodigy system)
**Data we have**: address, appraised value, market area ✅
**Data we're missing**: sqft, year built, beds, baths ❌
**Impact of gap**: HIGH — without sqft, can't calculate $/sqft (the core metric). Currently using appraised value within market area as proxy.
**Mitigation**: 253 market areas with median 90 properties = decent groupings. Value-based uniformity is weaker but still valid. Consider scraping RCAD's property search for individual sqft data.
**County quirks**:
- Smallest county (42K properties) — smallest market
- True Prodigy system same as Tarrant
**PDF must include**: Value-based uniformity within market area, acknowledge limitation, guide homeowner to verify their sqft on RCAD website

---

### Fort Bend County — FBCAD
**Portal**: fbcad.org
**Data we have**: address, sqft, beds, baths, year built, appraised value, pool, fireplaces, neighborhood, comps ✅
**Data gaps**: None significant — excellent data quality
**County quirks**:
- Evidence packet must be separately requested from FBCAD
- Growing Houston suburb market
**PDF must include**: Full equity comp grid with all characteristics

---

### Williamson County — WCAD
**Portal**: wcad.org
**Data we have**: address, appraised value ✅
**Data we're missing**: year built (all zeros in dataset), beds, baths ⚠️
**Impact of gap**: HIGH — similar to Rockwall situation but larger market (232K properties)
**Mitigation**: Group by city (Georgetown, Cedar Park, Round Rock, Leander) + value range. Consider enriching from WCAD property search.
**County quirks**:
- Austin metro suburb — fast appreciation
- Socrata API available for enrichment
**PDF must include**: Value-based uniformity within city groupings, guide homeowner to verify details on WCAD

---

### Travis County (Austin) — TCAD
**Portal**: traviscad.org
**Data we have**: address, sqft, year built, baths (91%), beds (34%), appraised value, neighborhood, comps ✅
**Data gaps**: beds only 34% — LOW impact (baths at 91% is solid, sqft is 100%)
**County quirks**:
- Wants 5 copies of evidence (not 4 like most counties)
- TCAD uses True Automation PACS — familiar format
- Austin market saw massive appreciation 2020-2022, now stabilizing — lots of overassessment
**PDF must include**: Full equity comp grid (sqft + baths), note beds where available

---

### Bexar County (San Antonio) — BCAD
**Portal**: bcadonline.org
**Data we have**: address, sqft, year built, appraised value, pool, neighborhood (2,635), comps ✅
**Data we're missing**: beds/baths ⚠️
**Impact of gap**: MEDIUM — sqft + year built + pool gives us strong comp matching
**County quirks**:
- 91% ARB success rate, ~200K protests/year — very active, very favorable
- New market for us — just uploaded 607K properties
**PDF must include**: Equity comp grid ($/sqft), neighborhood analysis, pool adjustment

---

### Cook County — CCBOR
**Portal**: appeals.cookcountyboardofreview.com
**Data we have**: address, PIN, sqft, beds, baths, year built, assessed value, market value, comps ✅
**Data gaps**: None significant — best data of all markets
**County quirks — Cook County is UNIQUE**:

- **Equalization factor** applied annually
- **Township reassessment cycle**: City of Chicago (2024, next 2027), North/NW suburbs (2023, next 2026), South/SW suburbs (2022, next 2025)
- **South suburbs may be actionable NOW** (2025 reassessment)
- Photos required if purchased within 3 years

- Complaint form must be official BOR form (no reproductions)
- File in duplicate for paper; online doesn't require duplicates
**PDF must include**:

## Section 3: Gap Analysis

### Data Gaps by Severity

| County | Missing Fields | Severity | Can We Fix Before May 15? |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Rockwall** | sqft, year built, beds, baths | 🔴 CRITICAL | Maybe — scrape RCAD property search |
| **Williamson** | year built, beds, baths | 🔴 CRITICAL | Maybe — enrich from WCAD Socrata/search |
| **Harris** | beds, baths | 🟡 MEDIUM | No — HCAD doesn't track. Not needed for §42.26. |
| **Tarrant** | beds, baths | 🟡 MEDIUM | No — TAD permanently zeroed. Use quality/condition. |
| **Denton** | beds, baths | 🟡 MEDIUM | Possible — check certified annual data (not nightly CSV) |
| **Bexar** | beds, baths | 🟡 MEDIUM | No — BCAD PACS doesn't include. Use sqft/year/pool. |
| **Collin** | beds (15.5%) | 🟢 LOW | Already at 84.5% — acceptable |
| **Travis** | beds (66%) | 🟢 LOW | Baths at 91%, sqft 100% — solid without beds |
| **Dallas** | None | ✅ NONE | — |
| **Fort Bend** | None | ✅ NONE | — |

## Section 4: Action Plan — Priority Order (Before May 15)

### 🔴 Priority 1: Content That Wins Hearings (Weeks 1-3)

These directly impact whether our customers WIN their protests:

1. **Write universal hearing script template** — "Here's exactly what to say in 5 minutes." Cover informal negotiation AND formal ARB. Include rebuttals for common appraiser arguments. One TX template, one IL template.
   - Effort: 2-3 days
   - Impact: MASSIVE — no other $49 product has this

2. **Add "Opinion of Value" to every packet** — Calculate recommended protest value (median comp appraised value). Homeowner needs a NUMBER to enter on the form.
   - Effort: 1 day (backend calculation change)
   - Impact: HIGH — many homeowners don't know what number to put

3. **Add property record audit page** — Side-by-side of CAD's records. Flag sqft discrepancies, missing features, incorrect data. Tell homeowner exactly what to verify.
   - Effort: 2-3 days
   - Impact: HIGH — record errors are easy wins

4. **Add "Request CAD Evidence Packet" instruction** — Tell TX customers: 14 days before your hearing, the CAD must provide their evidence. This is GOLD — use their own comps against them.
   - Effort: 1 day (add to filing guide)
   - Impact: HIGH — most DIY protesters don't know about this

### 🟠 Priority 2: County-Specific Filing Guides (Weeks 2-4)

5. **Build 10 TX county filing guides** — Step-by-step for each portal (iFile, uFile, True Prodigy, etc.). Which boxes to check. Where to upload. Screenshots if possible.
   - Effort: 1-2 days per county = 2-3 weeks
   - Impact: HIGH — removes friction from filing process

6. **Build Cook County dual-appeal guide** — CCAO appeal + CCBOR appeal. Two separate opportunities. Explain timeline.
   - Effort: 2-3 days
   - Impact: HIGH for Cook County customers

### 🟡 Priority 3: Data Enrichment (Weeks 3-6)

7. **Enrich Rockwall data** — Scrape sqft/year from RCAD property search. 42K properties = feasible.
   - Effort: 3-5 days
   - Impact: HIGH for Rockwall (currently weakest market)

8. **Enrich Williamson data** — Pull year_built from WCAD parcels dataset or property search.
   - Effort: 3-5 days  
   - Impact: HIGH for Williamson

9. **Check Denton certified annual data** — Nightly CSV lacks beds/baths but certified ZIP (413MB) might have them.
   - Effort: 1-2 days to check
   - Impact: MEDIUM

### 🟢 Priority 4: Polish & Differentiation (Weeks 4-8)

10. **Condition checklist / photo guide** — Template telling homeowners what to photograph.
    - Effort: 1 day
    - Impact: MEDIUM

11. **Homestead exemption flag** — Check if HS exemption is in our data, alert if missing.
    - Effort: 1 day
    - Impact: MEDIUM (some homeowners save thousands just from this)

12. **Money-back guarantee implementation** — Add to checkout flow and marketing.
    - Effort: 1 day
    - Impact: MEDIUM (conversion improvement)

13. **Pre-filled Form 50-132 generation** — Auto-populate TX protest form.
    - Effort: 3-5 days
    - Impact: MEDIUM (nice-to-have, big wow factor)

### Timeline Summary
| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Content that wins | Hearing script, opinion of value, property audit, CAD evidence request |
| 2-4 | Filing guides | 10 TX county guides + Cook County dual-appeal guide |
| 3-6 | Data enrichment | Rockwall sqft, Williamson year_built, Denton beds/baths check |
| 4-8 | Polish | Condition checklist, exemption flag, guarantee, pre-filled forms |

---

## Section 5: The Overtaxed Standard

### Every Packet Must Include (Universal)

1. **Professional cover letter / protest letter** — Pre-written, property-specific, references all evidence
2. **Equity/uniformity comp grid** — 5-10 comparable properties, adjusted, with median calculation
3. **Opinion of value** — The specific dollar amount to request
4. **Property record audit** — CAD characteristics check
5. **Filing guide** — County-specific, step-by-step
6. **Hearing preparation guide** — What to expect, what to say, what not to say
7. **Condition documentation guide** — What to photograph, how to get estimates

### Market-Specific Additions

**Texas counties additionally get:**
- §42.26 uniform & equal legal citation
- "Request CAD Evidence Packet" instructions
- Form 50-132 guidance (or pre-filled)
- iSettle explanation (Harris only)

**Cook County additionally gets:**
- Dual-appeal guidance (CCAO → CCBOR)
- 35 ILCS 200/16-70 citation
- Equalization factor explanation
- Township reassessment cycle context
- Sales comp analysis (IL is a disclosure state)

### Quality Standards
- **Comps must be genuinely comparable** — same neighborhood/area, similar size (±20% sqft), similar age (±15 years), similar features where data available
- **Adjustments must be transparent** — show WHY each comp was selected and any adjustments made
- **Numbers must be accurate** — double-check all calculations, median values, $/sqft
- **Legal citations must be correct** — verified statute sections
- **Filing instructions must be current** — verify portal URLs and procedures annually
- **Language must be accessible** — homeowner with no tax knowledge should understand everything

### The Customer Test
> A homeowner buys the $49 package on Monday. By Wednesday, they've filed their protest, know exactly what to say at their hearing, and have evidence that matches what a $300 professional firm would prepare. They walk into their hearing confident. That's the standard.
