3. **Existing users:** Log in with credentials
4. Once logged in, find your property and click **"File a Protest"** button
5. Select **reason(s) for protest** (checkboxes):
   - ☐ Value is over market value or otherwise incorrect
   - ☐ Value is unequal compared with other properties
   - ☐ Incorrect appraised (market) value
   - ☐ Other reasons as applicable
6. Enter your **"Taxpayer's Opinion of Value"** — the number you believe is correct
7. **Check the iSettle option** if you want automated settlement consideration
8. Upload evidence documents (PDF)
9. Submit — receive email confirmation immediately

### Required Information

- Saturday hearings available in June and July
- Instructions for remote hearings at https://hcad.org/property-owner-instructions-for-remote-meetings

### Evidence Packet Request
- After filing, HCAD provides their comparable sales data when they make the iSettle offer
- For formal ARB hearings, HCAD must provide evidence at least **14 days** before hearing
- Evidence viewable through the Owners Portal

### Special Features — iSettle
- **iSettle is HCAD's automated settlement system** — unique to Harris County
- After you iFile, an HCAD appraiser reviews your evidence + market data
- You receive an email with a settlement offer (value reduction)
- You can **accept or reject** the offer online
- If accepted → protest resolved, new value is final
- If rejected → case goes to formal ARB hearing

### Common Gotchas
- You MUST have your **iFile PIN** from your notice — can't be given over the phone
- Check the **iSettle box** when filing or you won't get an automated settlement offer
- **Enter an opinion of value** — if you leave it blank, iSettle won't work effectively
- iFile does NOT give you an informal in-person meeting — iSettle IS your informal step
- Paper protests still accepted but slower processing
- HCAD does NOT accept protests by fax or email
- If you miss the iSettle response window, you still go to ARB

## Research Notes & Limitations

1. **True Prodigy sites (Denton, Rockwall):** These are JavaScript-heavy single-page apps that don't render via simple web fetch. Detailed step-by-step screenshots require browser-based research during active protest season.

2. **Protest season timing:** Most portals only become fully active when notices are mailed (~April 15). Filing features may be grayed out or unavailable outside of protest season.

3. **2026 specifics:** Most counties haven't published 2026-specific dates yet (as of February 2026). Expect notices around April 15, 2026, with May 15 deadlines.

4. **Evidence upload limits:** Most portals accept PDF uploads. FBCAD confirmed 10MB limit. Other counties' limits are visible only within the logged-in portal.

5. **HCAD iSettle is unique:** No other county has an equivalent automated settlement system by this name. TAD has "Value Negotiation" and FBCAD has "Online Appeal" (appraiser review), which serve similar functions.

6. **All counties accept Form 50-132** by mail as a fallback option, regardless of their online portal capabilities.
