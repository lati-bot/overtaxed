# Illinois County Expansion Analysis for Overtaxed

**Prepared:** February 16, 2026  
**Current Coverage:** Cook County (Chicago)  
**Purpose:** Identify the best IL counties for Overtaxed expansion

---

## Executive Summary

Illinois has the **highest effective property tax rate in the nation at 1.92%** (SmartAsset), with the median homeowner paying $5,399/year. The Chicago collar counties (DuPage, Lake, Will, Kane, McHenry) represent the most attractive expansion targets due to high property values, high tax rates, data availability, and geographic proximity to Cook County.

**Recommended next 3 counties:** DuPage → Lake → Will

## 2. Reassessment Cycles

| County | Cycle | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Cook** | Triennial (by triad) | City, North Tri, South Tri rotate annually |
| **All other IL counties** | **Quadrennial** (every 4 years) | Full reassessment every 4 years, but assessors may adjust annually via township multipliers |
| **Lake County** | Quadrennial; next in **2027** | Annual notices still issued |

**Key insight:** Outside Cook, IL uses a quadrennial cycle. However, county assessors can apply township multipliers in non-quad years, so assessments can change annually. Appeal windows typically open after assessment notices are mailed (varies by county, usually spring/summer). Board of Review hearings follow.

**Appeal Process (non-Cook):**
1. Assessment notices mailed (typically spring)
2. 30-day window to file complaint with Board of Review
3. Board of Review hearings
4. If unsatisfied → appeal to Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB) or circuit court

## 3. Strategic Ranking: Top 10 IL Counties

| Rank | County | Score | Rationale |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **DuPage** | ★★★★★ | Highest home values ($409K), excellent free data, adjacent to Cook, ~330K parcels |
| 2 | **Lake** | ★★★★★ | Highest tax bills ($8,943!), 2.43% rate, excellent data, quad reassessment 2027 |
| 3 | **Will** | ★★★★☆ | Large/growing county, free shapefile downloads, 2.12% rate, adjacent to Cook |
| 4 | **Kane** | ★★★★☆ | High taxes ($7,219), adjacent to Cook, good size; data access needs verification |
| 5 | **McHenry** | ★★★☆☆ | 2.18% rate, collar county; smaller TAM (~150K), data access unclear |
| 6 | **Kendall** | ★★★☆☆ | 2.20% rate, fast-growing; small population (~130K) limits TAM |
| 7 | **DeKalb** | ★★★☆☆ | 2.30% rate (very high!); small county, NIU student population |
| 8 | **Winnebago** | ★★☆☆☆ | 2.16% rate; low home values ($181K), not adjacent to Cook |
| 9 | **Peoria** | ★★☆☆☆ | 2.23% rate; low home values, small TAM, far from Cook |
| 10 | **Champaign** | ★★☆☆☆ | 1.97% rate; university town, small owner-occupier base |

## 4. Recommended Expansion Sequence

### Phase 1: DuPage County (Launch Q2-Q3 2026)
- **Why now:** Excellent free data, highest home values, maximum revenue per appeal
- **Data source:** https://gisdata-dupage.opendata.arcgis.com/ (bulk parcel download)
- **Est. TAM:** 330K+ residential parcels × $409K median value
- **Revenue potential:** If 2% conversion at $200 avg fee = $1.3M+

### Phase 2: Lake County (Launch Q4 2026 or Q1 2027)
- **Why:** Highest absolute tax pain in IL, 2027 quadrennial reassessment creates urgency
- **Timing advantage:** Launch BEFORE 2027 reassessment notices go out
- **Data source:** https://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/
- **Est. TAM:** 250K+ residential parcels × $368K median value

### Phase 3: Will County (Launch Q2 2027)
- **Why:** Large growing county, free data downloads, completes the southern collar
- **Data source:** https://willcounty.gov/County-Offices/Administration/GIS-Division/Data/Vector
- **Est. TAM:** 240K+ residential parcels × $340K median value

### Combined Collar County Opportunity
Adding DuPage + Lake + Will to Cook gives Overtaxed coverage of **~75% of the Chicago metro population** and the vast majority of high-value residential properties in Illinois.

## 5. Monitoring Recommendations

| What to Watch | When | Why |
|---------------|------|-----|
| Lake County 2027 quadrennial reassessment timeline | Q3-Q4 2026 | Time launch for maximum impact |
| DuPage open data portal updates | Monthly | Ensure data feeds remain available |
| Will County GIS data freshness | Quarterly | Track shapefile update schedule |
| Kane County open data initiatives | Quarterly | May open up bulk downloads |
| IL PTAB (Property Tax Appeal Board) filing stats | Annually | Shows which counties have highest appeal volumes |
| IL Dept of Revenue property tax statistics | Annually | https://tax.illinois.gov/research/taxstats/propertytaxstatistics.html |
| Competitor activity in collar counties | Ongoing | Watch for other prop-tax appeal startups entering these markets |
| Legislative changes (PTELL, exemptions) | Ongoing | Could affect appeal economics |

## 7. Risks & Considerations

1. **Non-Cook appeal process is different:** Outside Cook, appeals go to local Board of Review → PTAB (state level). Cook has its own Board of Review + CCAO. Product/UX will need county-specific appeal workflows.

2. **Assessment level difference:** Cook uses 10% assessment level (with state equalizer ~3.0x). All other counties use 33.33%. Comps analysis methodology may need adjustment.

3. **Quadrennial vs Triennial timing:** Non-Cook counties reassess every 4 years. Appeal urgency is highest in reassessment years. Need to track each county's quad cycle.

4. **Data richness varies:** Cook County data (via Socrata/cookcountyassessor.com) is exceptionally detailed with sales, characteristics, appeals history. Collar county data may be geometry + basic attributes only — may need to scrape assessor sites for detailed property characteristics.

5. **Market dynamics:** Collar county homeowners may be less aware of appeal rights than Cook County residents, which is both a challenge (education needed) and opportunity (untapped market).
