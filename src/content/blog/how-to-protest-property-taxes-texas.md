If you're a Texas homeowner, there's a good chance you're overpaying on property taxes — and the system is actually designed to let you fight back.

Every year, **more than 65% of property tax protests in Texas result in a reduction**. The average homeowner who protests saves around **$1,136 per year**. And here's the best part: your appraised value **cannot go up** as a result of protesting. You literally have nothing to lose.

Yet most homeowners never file a protest. They assume the county got it right, or that the process is too complicated. It's not. This guide walks you through every step — from checking your appraisal notice to attending a hearing — so you can protest your property taxes with confidence.

## Why You Should Protest Your Property Taxes

Texas has no state income tax, which means local governments rely heavily on property taxes. Your county appraisal district (CAD) determines your home's appraised value each year, and that value directly affects your tax bill.

Here's the problem: **appraisal districts tend to over-appraise**. They're working with mass appraisal models, limited data, and tight timelines. They can't inspect every home. So they estimate — and those estimates often skew high.

The numbers tell the story:

- **65%+ of protests succeed** in major Texas counties
- **Average savings: $1,136/year** (that compounds — a $1,136 reduction this year saves you that amount *every* year going forward)
- **Your value can't increase** from protesting — worst case, it stays the same
- **It's free to file** — no cost to protest

If your neighbor's identical home is appraised at $350,000 and yours is at $400,000, you have a clear case. And even if the gap isn't that obvious, there's almost always room to push back.

## Who Can Protest?

**Any property owner in Texas can protest their property tax appraisal.** This includes:

- Single-family homeowners
- Condo and townhome owners
- Owners of rental properties
- Commercial property owners
- Land owners

You don't need to be a U.S. citizen. You don't need a lawyer. You don't need any special qualifications. If you own property in Texas, you have the right to protest under the [Texas Property Tax Code](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TX/htm/TX.41.htm).

## Texas Property Tax Protest Deadline 2026

The deadline to file your protest is **May 15, 2026** — or **30 days after your appraisal notice is mailed**, whichever is later.

Most appraisal notices go out in April, so for most homeowners, May 15 is the effective deadline. But if your notice arrives late (say, May 1), you'd have until May 31.

**Don't wait until the last day.** Filing early gives you:

- More appointment time slots to choose from
- A chance to receive an informal settlement offer (some counties send "iSettle" or similar offers to early filers)
- Less stress

Mark your calendar now: **May 15, 2026**.

## Step 1: Check Your Appraisal Notice

Your appraisal notice typically arrives by mail in mid-April. You can also look it up online through your county's appraisal district website. The notice shows:

- **Your property's appraised value** — this is what the county thinks your home is worth
- **Your assessed value** — after the homestead cap (10% max annual increase), this is what you're actually taxed on
- **Last year's value** — for comparison

**What to look for:**

- **Big jumps** — Did your appraised value increase 15%, 20%, or more? That's a red flag.
- **Incorrect details** — Wrong square footage, bedroom/bathroom count, lot size, or year built? These errors directly inflate your value.
- **Condition issues** — Does the appraisal account for that foundation crack, aging roof, or outdated kitchen? Probably not.

Even if the value increase seems "reasonable," it's still worth checking whether your appraised value is in line with comparable properties. That's where the real savings are.

## Step 2: Gather Your Evidence

This is the most important step. A protest without evidence is just a complaint. You need data.

### Comparable Sales (Market Value Argument)

Find **3-5 recently sold homes** near you that are similar in size, age, and condition — but sold for less than your appraised value. These are your "comps."

Look for homes that:
- Sold within the last 12 months
- Are within 1 mile of your property (closer is better)
- Have similar square footage (within 15-20%)
- Have a similar lot size, year built, and bedroom/bathroom count

**Focus on price per square foot ($/sqft).** This is the single most important metric in a property tax protest. If comparable homes sold at $180/sqft and you're appraised at $220/sqft, that's a strong argument.

### Uniform & Equal Argument

This is a powerful — and often overlooked — argument. Under Texas law, your property must be appraised **uniformly** compared to similar properties. That means if comparable homes in your neighborhood are appraised at lower values, yours should be too — even if the market says your home is worth more.

Think of it this way: it's not just about what your home is *worth*, it's about what the county is *appraising similar homes at*. If your home is appraised at $400,000 but five similar homes on your street are appraised at $340,000-$360,000, you have a uniform and equal case.

This argument uses **appraisal district data** (not sale prices), so the evidence comes directly from the county's own records.

### Other Evidence

- **Photos** of property damage, deferred maintenance, or needed repairs
- **Contractor estimates** for major repairs (foundation, roof, HVAC)
- **Neighborhood factors** — nearby construction, flooding issues, highway noise

## Step 3: File Your Protest

You can file online or by mail. Online is faster and easier.

### Online Filing by County

Here's where to file in the major Texas counties:

| **Tarrant** (Fort Worth) | True Prodigy | [tad.org](https://tad.org) |
| **Travis** (Austin) | Online Protest | [traviscad.org](https://traviscad.org) |
| **Collin** (Plano/Frisco) | Online Portal | [onlineportal.collincad.org](https://onlineportal.collincad.org) |
| **Denton** | Online Appeals | [appeals.dentoncad.com](https://appeals.dentoncad.com) (seasonal) |
| **Fort Bend** (Sugar Land) | Online Protest | [fbcad.org](https://fbcad.org) |
| **Williamson** (Round Rock) | Online Protest | [wcad.org](https://wcad.org) |
| **Bexar** (San Antonio) | Online Protest | [bcad.org](https://bcad.org) |
| **Rockwall** | Online Protest | [rockwallcad.com](https://rockwallcad.com) |

### Filing by Mail

If you prefer paper, download **Form 50-132** (Notice of Protest) from your county's website or the Texas Comptroller's site. Fill it out and mail it to your county appraisal district. Make sure it's **postmarked by the deadline**.

### What to Select on Your Protest Form

When filing, you'll typically choose your reason for protesting. Select:

- **"Value is over market value"** — if you have comp sales evidence
- **"Value is unequal compared with other properties"** — if you're using the uniform & equal argument

**Pro tip:** Select both. It gives you two separate arguments at your hearing.

## Step 4: Attend the Informal Hearing

After filing, your county will schedule an **informal hearing** — a one-on-one meeting with an appraiser. This is where most protests get resolved.

**What to expect:**

- It's usually a 15-20 minute meeting (in person or by phone, depending on the county)
- You'll present your evidence, and the appraiser will present theirs
- It's a negotiation — they may offer a reduced value

**Tips for success:**

1. **Stick to $/sqft.** Don't argue emotions. Show your comps, point to the price per square foot, and let the numbers do the talking.
2. **Be polite and professional.** The appraiser isn't your enemy — they review hundreds of protests and respond well to respectful, data-driven conversations.
3. **Bring printed copies.** Have your evidence organized and printed. Give a copy to the appraiser. This shows you're prepared.
4. **Know your target number.** Before the meeting, decide what value you'd accept. If they offer something close, consider taking it.
5. **Don't reveal your bottom line.** Start lower than your target so you have room to negotiate.

Many counties now offer settlement tools (like Harris County's iSettle) where they make an offer before the hearing. If the offer looks fair, you can accept it and skip the meeting entirely.

## Step 5: ARB Hearing (If Needed)

If the informal hearing doesn't resolve your case — or you're not satisfied with the offer — you can escalate to the **Appraisal Review Board (ARB)**.

The ARB is an independent panel (usually 3 members) that hears your case and the appraisal district's case, then makes a binding decision.

**When to escalate:**

- The informal offer was significantly above what your evidence supports
- The appraiser wouldn't negotiate meaningfully
- You have strong evidence and believe the ARB will side with you

**How it works:**

1. You'll receive a hearing date and time
2. You present your evidence (comps, photos, uniform & equal data)
3. The appraisal district presents their evidence
4. The board members ask questions and vote on a value
5. The decision is binding (though you can appeal to district court or binding arbitration for an additional fee)

**ARB tips:**

- Present the same evidence you used at the informal, but be more structured
- Bring multiple copies for each board member
- Keep it brief and focused — 10-15 minutes is ideal
- Stick to facts and data, not opinions

## DIY vs. Hiring Help

### DIY Protest

**Pros:**
- No cost beyond your time
- You learn the process
- You know your property best

**Cons:**
- Research is time-consuming (finding comps, calculating $/sqft, understanding uniform & equal)
- You may miss arguments a professional would catch
- It can feel intimidating if you've never done it

### Hiring a Property Tax Consultant

**Pros:**
- They handle everything
- Experience with local appraisal districts

**Cons:**
- Typically charge 30-50% of tax savings — if they save you $1,000, you pay $300-$500
- Many won't take your case if the potential savings are small
- You have less control over the process
