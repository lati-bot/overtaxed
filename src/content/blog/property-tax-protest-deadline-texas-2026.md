The most common reason Texans miss out on property tax savings? **They miss the deadline.**

Every year, thousands of homeowners intend to protest but let the filing window close. Don't be one of them. Here's everything you need to know about the 2026 Texas property tax protest deadline — broken down by county.

## The 2026 Texas Property Tax Protest Deadline

The statutory deadline is straightforward:

> **May 15, 2026** — or **30 days after your appraisal notice is mailed** — whichever is later.

For most homeowners, appraisal notices arrive in mid-to-late April, making May 15 the effective deadline. But if your county mails notices late, your window extends.

**Important:** The deadline is based on the **mailing date** on your notice, not when you receive it. Check the date printed on the notice itself.

## County-by-County Filing Guide

Here's where and how to file your protest in every major Texas county:

| County | Metro Area | Portal URL | Online Filing | Deadline |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Harris** | Houston | [hcad.org](https://hcad.org) (iFile) | ✅ Yes | May 15 |
| **Dallas** | Dallas | [dcad.org](https://dcad.org) (uFile) | ✅ Yes | May 15 |
| **Tarrant** | Fort Worth | [tad.org](https://tad.org) (True Prodigy) | ✅ Yes | May 15 |
| **Travis** | Austin | [traviscad.org](https://traviscad.org) | ✅ Yes | May 15 |
| **Bexar** | San Antonio | [bcad.org](https://bcad.org) | ✅ Yes | May 15 |
| **Collin** | Plano / Frisco | [onlineportal.collincad.org](https://onlineportal.collincad.org) | ✅ Yes | May 15 |
| **Denton** | Denton | [appeals.dentoncad.com](https://appeals.dentoncad.com) | ✅ Seasonal | May 15 |
| **Fort Bend** | Sugar Land | [fbcad.org](https://fbcad.org) | ✅ Yes | May 15 |
| **Williamson** | Round Rock | [wcad.org](https://wcad.org) | ✅ Yes | May 15 |
| **Rockwall** | Rockwall | [rockwallcad.com](https://rockwallcad.com) | ✅ Yes | May 15 |

**Notes:**

- All counties accept **Form 50-132** (Notice of Protest) by mail as an alternative to online filing.
- Denton County's online portal is seasonal — it opens when appraisal notices are mailed (typically mid-April).
- The "May 15" deadline assumes your notice was mailed before April 15. If it was mailed later, you have 30 days from the mailing date.

## Why You Should File Early

Don't wait until May 14 to file. Here's why early filing gives you an edge:

### More Hearing Slots

Counties schedule informal hearings on a first-come, first-served basis. Early filers get more options — including the ability to pick a convenient date and time. Late filers often get stuck with whatever's left, which might mean taking time off work.

### iSettle and Early Settlement Offers

Several counties (notably Harris) send early settlement offers to protesters before hearings even begin. These "iSettle" offers can save you time — if the number looks fair, you accept and you're done. No hearing needed.

You only get these offers if you've filed early enough for the county to process your protest before the rush.

### Less Competition

Appraisal districts handle hundreds of thousands of protests. The earlier you file, the more attention your case may receive. As the deadline approaches, staff are overwhelmed and informal hearings become more rushed.

## What Happens If You Miss the Deadline

If May 15 has come and gone and you haven't filed, you still have limited options:

### Late Filing Under §41.41

Texas Property Tax Code §41.41(a)(2) allows late protests if you can show **good cause** for missing the deadline. Good cause typically means:

- You didn't receive your appraisal notice (moved, bad address on file)
- A medical emergency or military deployment prevented you from filing
- The appraisal district made an error

The late filing window generally extends to the day before taxes become delinquent — but the bar for "good cause" is higher, and not all appraisal review boards are lenient.

### §25.25 Corrections

If there's a **factual error** in your appraisal — wrong square footage, incorrect property characteristics, or a clerical mistake — you can file a §25.25 correction motion even after the protest deadline. This isn't technically a protest, but it can still reduce your value.

### Bottom Line

Late options exist, but they're harder to win and more limited in scope. **File on time.**

## How to File Your Protest in 15 Minutes

The process is simpler than most people think:

1. **Go to your county's portal** (see the table above)
2. **Look up your property** by address or account number
3. **Select "File Protest"** or "Notice of Protest"
4. **Choose your reason**: "Value is over market value" and/or "Value is unequal compared with other properties"
5. **Submit** — you'll receive a confirmation with your hearing date

That's it. You're officially protesting.

The harder part is **gathering evidence** to present at your hearing. You'll need comparable sales data, price-per-square-foot analysis, and ideally a uniform & equal comparison. This research can take hours if you're doing it yourself.

**Or you can skip it.** [Overtaxed](/houston) builds your evidence packet for $49 — comparable properties, $/sqft analysis, cover letter, and a filing guide specific to your county. Whether you're in [Houston](/houston), [Dallas](/dallas), [Austin](/austin), [San Antonio](/san-antonio), or [Chicago](/chicago), we've got you covered.

Don't let the deadline pass. File your protest today, and fight for the tax bill you actually deserve.
