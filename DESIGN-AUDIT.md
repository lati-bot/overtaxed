# Property Tax Appeal UI/UX Competitive Audit
**GetOvertaxed.com Results Page Analysis**  
*Date: February 11, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line:** Your results page is clean and functional, but it's losing conversions because it looks like a prototype, not a product worth $49. It lacks the trust signals, urgency, and emotional hooks that competitors use effectively. A first-time visitor from Google would think: "Is this legitimate? Why should I trust you? What am I actually getting?"

**Key Problem:** You're asking someone to pay $49 based on a calculator result alone. Competitors don't do that—they build trust first, then sell.

## Competitor Analysis

### 1. Ownwell.com — The Gold Standard

**What They Do Right:**

- **Immediate Trust Building:** Hero section leads with "Trusted By More Homeowners Than Anyone Else" + massive social proof (88% success rate, $774 avg savings, 4.7★ rating)
- **Big Numbers:** "$400,000,000+ In savings since 2019" — creates instant credibility
- **Visual Storytelling:** Illustrated house graphics, friendly color palette (blue/green/white)
- **Extensive Social Proof:** Multiple 5-star testimonial cards with real quotes, "Sign Up in Less Than 3 Minutes" timeline
- **Featured Experts:** Photos and bios of actual property tax experts with credentials
- **Professional Typography:** Large, bold headers with great hierarchy
- **Color Psychology:** Blue (trust) + green (savings/money) + clean white space
- **Clear Value Prop:** "How You Can Save" section breaks down their process visually
- **Strategic CTA Placement:** Multiple CTAs throughout scroll (not just one at top)

**Key Insight:** They never ask you to buy until they've proven they're trustworthy and expert.

---

### 2. NTPTS.com — Local Authority Play

**What They Do Right:**

- **Immediate Credibility:** Shows real savings example "$115,581" in hero
- **Process Transparency:** Clear step-by-step "How It Works" with icons
- **Team Photos:** Full team photo showing they're real people, not a landing page
- **Local Focus:** "North Texas" branding creates regional authority
- **Dark Blue Color:** Professional, corporate, trustworthy
- **Multiple CTAs:** Red buttons throughout for visibility

**What's Less Effective:**

- Somewhat dated design (feels 2018-era)
- Heavy blocks of text reduce scannability
- Less white space makes it feel cluttered
- Mobile experience would be challenging

**Key Insight:** They compensate for older design with strong credibility signals (team, process, real examples).

---

### 3. CutMyTaxes.com (O'Connor) — Established Firm Approach

**What They Do Right:**

- **Immediate Value Prop:** "Are You Overpaying On Your Property Taxes?" headline addresses pain point
- **Navigation Tabs:** Different property types clearly segmented
- **Property Tax Protection Program:** Upsell/ongoing service prominently featured
- **Testimonials:** Avatar-based testimonials with names and verification
- **News Section:** "The Latest News" adds authority and freshness
- **Multiple Locations:** Shows they're established with physical offices
- **Contact Options:** Phone number visible throughout

**What's Less Effective:**

- Green color scheme feels slightly dated/corporate
- Illustration style is generic stock art
- Information architecture is confusing (too many sections)
- No clear hierarchy on what matters most

**Key Insight:** They lean on "established business" credibility more than modern design.

---

## Your Page (GetOvertaxed.com/results) — Brutally Honest Assessment

### What You're Doing Right ✅

1. **Clean, Modern Design:** Your minimalist aesthetic is refreshing and feels 2025+
2. **Clear Data Presentation:** Property info, current vs. after protest comparison is very clear
3. **Good Color Coding:** Pink (bad) vs. mint green (good) works intuitively
4. **Simple Metrics:** Annual savings, 5-year projection, tax bill reduction % are smart
5. **Neighborhood Context:** Showing 49% over-appraised rate adds validation
6. **Fast Load/Responsive:** Page appears lightweight and quick
7. **One Clear CTA:** Purple button stands out against mint background

### What's Killing Your Conversions ❌

#### 1. **Zero Trust Signals** (Critical)
- No testimonials, reviews, or star ratings anywhere
- No photos of team members or experts
- No "As Seen In" media logos
- No trust badges (BBB, licensing, certifications)
- No case studies or success stories
- **First-time visitor thinks:** "Who are you? Why should I trust you with $49?"

#### 2. **Looks Unfinished** (Major)
- The design is *too* minimal—borders on "MVP prototype"
- Huge white spaces feel empty, not premium
- Single card floating in white void lacks context
- No header with logo/branding on results page
- Footer is barely visible (tiny gray text)
- **First-time visitor thinks:** "Is this a real company or someone's side project?"

#### 3. **No Emotional Connection** (Major)
- All numbers, zero storytelling
- No human element (photos, names, faces)
- Copy is purely functional—no personality
- Doesn't address fears or concerns
- **First-time visitor thinks:** "This feels like a calculator, not a service."

#### 4. **Weak Value Proposition** (Major)
- "Get your complete protest package" — what does that actually mean?
- Small gray text below explains, but it's easily missed
- "Comparable properties, hearing script, and step-by-step filing instructions" — sounds like homework
- Doesn't emphasize the value: "We do the hard work, you just sign"
- **First-time visitor thinks:** "So I'm paying $49 to do work myself?"

#### 5. **No Urgency or Scarcity** (Moderate)
- Nothing creates FOMO or deadline pressure
- No "protest deadline approaching" warning
- No "X people in your neighborhood already filed"
- Static page feels like it'll be there forever
- **First-time visitor thinks:** "I'll come back to this later." (They won't.)

#### 6. **Single CTA Strategy** (Moderate)
- Only one conversion point (purple button)
- No secondary CTAs ("Learn More," "See Examples," "How It Works")
- Huge scroll distance with no action points
- If someone's not ready to pay $49 immediately, you've lost them
- **Result:** High bounce rate

#### 7. **Typography & Hierarchy Issues** (Minor but Impactful)
- Headlines are good size but lack weight/personality
- Body copy is small and light (low contrast = low readability)
- "overtaxed" logo/wordmark is tiny and easily missed
- Numbers are big but don't feel premium (use better font)
- **First impression:** "Budget template site"

#### 8. **Color Palette Lacks Personality** (Minor)
- Mint green + gray + white = inoffensive but forgettable
- Purple CTA is good but feels disconnected from brand
- No bold accent colors to create energy/excitement
- Feels clinical, not exciting
- **Emotional response:** "Meh."

#### 9. **Missing Key Sections** (Critical)
- No "How It Works" explanation
- No "What You Get" breakdown
- No "Why Us?" section
- No FAQ addressing concerns
- No risk reversal (money-back guarantee?)
- No comparison chart (DIY vs. us vs. hiring lawyer)
- **Result:** Unanswered questions = no purchase

#### 10. **Mobile Experience Unknown** (Risk)
- Screenshot shows desktop, but most traffic is mobile
- If those side-by-side cards don't stack well, you're dead
- Is the CTA sticky on mobile?

## Specific Recommendations for Improvement

### Priority 1: Add Trust Signals (Do This First)

**Add immediately:**

1. **Above the fold:**
   - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "4.8/5 from 2,347 Texas homeowners" (if true—if not, get reviews!)
   - "Trusted by X homeowners" badge
   - "Average savings: $X" prominently displayed

2. **Below results section:**
   - **Testimonials block:** 3-6 cards with real photos, names, cities, and star ratings
   - Example: *"SavedSaved $3,200 on my Houston property. The script was perfect!" — Jennifer M., Houston*
   - Include specific savings amounts and locations

3. **Sidebar or banner:**
   - "As featured in" with Houston Chronicle, local news, or property tax forums
   - BBB rating if you have one
   - "Licensed Texas Property Tax Consultants" or similar credential

4. **Team section:**
   - "Meet Your Tax Appeal Team" with photos and 2-sentence bios
   - Shows you're real people, not a faceless service
   - Include credentials: "Former Harris County Appraiser" type stuff

**Copy example:**
```
✓ 2,347+ successful protests filed
✓ $12.3M saved for Texas homeowners  
✓ 4.8★ average rating
✓ Licensed by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation
```

---

### Priority 2: Redesign the Layout

**Header/Hero Section:**
```
[Logo: overtaxed - larger, bolder]     [Trust Badge] [4.8★ 2.3K reviews]

[Property Address]
[Appraisal Value — big and bold]

[Status Banner]: 🎉 Great News! You're Over-Appraised by 16%
```

**Results Card (Redesign):**
- Add a subtle gradient or shadow to make card feel elevated
- Increase padding/whitespace *within* card (currently too tight)
- Make numbers bigger and use a bolder font (try SF Pro Display Bold or similar)
- Add icons next to metrics (💰 Annual Savings, 📅 Over 5 Years, 📉 Reduction)

**Before/After Section:**
- Add animation or arrow between cards (make it feel dynamic)
- Include small "vs." or "→" icon
- Add micro-copy: "Your current tax bill" and "Your bill after successful protest"

**CTA Section (Completely Redesign):**

Current:
```
Get your complete protest package
[small gray text with details]
[Button: Get Your Protest Package — $49]
```

Should be:
```
🎯 Get Your Complete Protest Package

Everything you need to protest and win:
✓ Custom hearing script written for your property  
✓ 5 comparable properties with analysis
✓ Step-by-step filing instructions for Harris County
✓ Email support if you have questions

[Large button: Get Started — Only $49] [One-time fee, instant delivery]

💡 Pays for itself if your bill drops by just $50/year
🔒 Secure payment • Delivered instantly to your email
⏰ 2024 protest deadline: May 15, 2026
```

See the difference? You're selling the value, not just listing features.

---

### Priority 3: Add Supporting Sections

**1. "How It Works" Section** (Add below CTA)
```
How It Works (3 Simple Steps)

1️⃣ We Build Your Case
   Our system analyzes your property + finds the best comparables

2️⃣ You Get Your Package
   Delivered instantly: hearing script, evidence, filing guide

3️⃣ File & Save
   Follow our simple guide or we can file for you (+$20)
   
[Secondary CTA: See a Sample Package]
```

**2. "What You're Getting" Section**
Show mockups or screenshots of the actual documents. People need to *see* what they're buying.

```
Your $49 Package Includes:

[Image: Sample Script] → Professional Hearing Script
    A word-for-word script written specifically for your property
    
[Image: Comparables] → 5 Comp Properties
    Recently sold homes proving your assessment is too high
    
[Image: Instructions] → Step-by-Step Guide  
    Exact filing instructions + dates for Houston
    
[Image: Support] → Email Support
    Questions? We'll help you through it.
```

**3. FAQ Section**
Address objections directly:

- "What if I don't save money?" → Money-back guarantee (if you offer one)
- "Is this legal?" → Yes, explain the formal protest process
- "Can I do this myself for free?" → Yes, but it takes 10+ hours of research
- "What if I mess up the hearing?" → Our script makes it simple, or we'll file for you
- "When's the deadline?" → Specific date with urgency

---

### Priority 4: Fix Typography & Visual Design

**Typography:**
- **Logo:** Make "overtaxed" 2-3x bigger. Add a tagline: "overtaxed | Texas Property Tax Appeals"
- **Headlines:** Use a bolder weight (currently too thin)
  - Property address: 32px bold
  - "You're Over-Appraised": 24px semibold
  - Numbers: 48px bold (seriously, make them pop)
- **Body copy:** Increase font size from ~14px to 16px, improve contrast (darker gray)
- **Button text:** "Get Your Protest Package" is long—try "Get Started" or "Get My Package"

**Colors:**
- Keep mint green but make it more vibrant (currently washed out)
- Add a secondary accent: 
  - Gold/yellow for savings amounts (makes them feel valuable)
  - Navy blue for trust elements
- Make purple CTA button deeper/richer (current purple is okay but could be more premium)
- Increase contrast on all text (lots of light gray on white is hard to read)

**Visual Elements:**
- Add icons throughout (coins for savings, calendar for dates, checkmarks for benefits)
- Consider subtle background patterns or gradients (pure white feels empty)
- Add property photo if available (makes it personal)
- Include illustration or photo of happy homeowner (human connection)

---

### Priority 5: Create Urgency & Scarcity

**Add these elements:**

1. **Countdown Timer** (if deadline is real):
   ```
   ⏰ Houston protest deadline: May 15, 2026
   [Countdown: 92 days remaining]
   ```

2. **Social Proof Notifications** (animated):
   ```
   🔔 "Sarah K. from Cypress just filed her protest (12 min ago)"
   🔔 "164 Houston homeowners protested this week"
   ```

3. **Limited Time Offers** (if applicable):
   ```
   💎 Early Bird Special: $49 → $39 (ends Feb 28)
   ```

4. **Risk Reversal:**
   ```
   😊 100% Money-Back Guarantee
   If you're not satisfied with your package, we'll refund you. No questions asked.
   ```

---

### Priority 6: Improve Information Architecture

**Recommended page structure:**

1. **Header** (Logo + Trust Badge + Reviews)
2. **Hero** (Property info + "You're Over-Appraised" banner)
3. **Results Card** (Current vs. After + Metrics)
4. **Social Proof Bar** ("Join 2,347 Texans who saved money")
5. **Primary CTA Section** (Big, detailed explanation of package)
6. **How It Works** (3-step process)
7. **What You Get** (Visual breakdown of deliverables)
8. **Testimonials** (6 cards with real people)
9. **Comparison Chart** (DIY vs. Overtaxed vs. Lawyer)
10. **FAQ** (Address objections)
11. **Neighborhood Stats** (Current position is fine)
12. **Final CTA** (Repeat offer with urgency)
13. **Footer** (Real company info, contact, privacy policy)

**Key:** Each section should have a micro-CTA or next action.

---

### Priority 7: Optimize the CTA

**Current button:** "Get Your Protest Package — $49"

**Problems:**
- "Protest Package" sounds like bureaucracy
- $49 feels expensive without context
- No urgency or benefit in copy

**Better options:**

Option 1 (Value-focused):
```
[Button: Get My $1,500 Savings Package — $49]
Below: One-time fee • Instant delivery • Money-back guarantee
```

Option 2 (Action-focused):
```
[Button: Start My Protest — $49]
Below: Save $1,500/year • Delivered in 2 minutes
```

Option 3 (Outcome-focused):
```
[Button: Lower My Tax Bill — $49]
Below: Everything you need to protest and win
```

**Button design:**
- Make it larger (current size is okay but could be more prominent)
- Add subtle animation on hover (lift effect or glow)
- Consider making it sticky on scroll (mobile especially)
- Add icon: "→" or "✓" inside button

---

### Priority 8: Add Mobile-Specific Optimizations

**Must-haves for mobile:**
- Sticky CTA button at bottom of screen
- Tap-to-call phone number (if you offer phone support)
- Simplified navigation (hamburger menu)
- Cards stack vertically with good spacing
- Larger touch targets (buttons, links)
- Reduced text, more icons/visuals

---

## Competitive Positioning Analysis

### Where You Sit Now:
- **Design Quality:** 7/10 (clean but unfinished)
- **Trust Signals:** 2/10 (basically none)
- **Value Communication:** 5/10 (shows savings but doesn't sell it)
- **Urgency:** 1/10 (none)
- **Overall Conversion Potential:** 4/10

### Where Competitors Sit:

|--------|---------|-------|----------|--------------|

| Conversion Optimization | 9/10 | 7/10 | 6/10 | **4/10** |

   - Answer questions in real-time
   - Reduces friction to purchase

---

## The Brutal Truth

Your page right now is what I'd expect from a talented developer who built an MVP in a weekend. It *works*, but it doesn't *sell*. 

You're competing against companies that have spent years optimizing for conversions. They know that people don't buy based on logic (savings calculator) alone—they buy based on trust, emotion, urgency, and social proof.

**What a first-time Google visitor sees:**
- Overtaxed: "Interesting calculator, but who are these people? Pass."
- Ownwell: "Wow, 88% success rate? $400M saved? 4.7 stars? Let me keep reading..."

**The gap is not in your product or your numbers—it's in how you present them.**

The good news? Your design foundation is actually better than most competitors. You just need to add the meat to the bones.

---

## ROI Projection

**Current conversion rate (estimated):** 2-3%  
**After implementing Priority 1-3 recommendations:** 8-12%  
**Potential revenue increase:** 3-4x

**If you get 1,000 visitors/month:**
- Current: 20-30 conversions = $980-$1,470/month
- After improvements: 80-120 conversions = $3,920-$5,880/month

**Time investment:** 20-40 hours of design/dev work  
**Potential payback period:** 1-2 weeks

---

## Final Recommendation: The MVP+Trust Formula

You don't need to rebuild everything. You need to add three things:

1. **Trust** (testimonials, reviews, team, credentials)
2. **Value** (better copy explaining what they get and why it matters)
3. **Urgency** (deadlines, scarcity, risk reversal)

Everything else is optimization. But without these three, even the best design won't convert.

**Next step:** Pick 3-5 quick wins from the list above and ship them this week. Measure the impact. Then tackle the next batch.
