**Title:** your HCAD notice probably went up again. here's what to do about it

So my appraised value jumped like 12% this year which is insane because literally nothing changed about my house. Looked into it and apparently ~70% of people who protest get a reduction? I wish I knew that years ago.

Anyway I went through the whole process last year and it's not that bad. You file on hcad.org (iFile system), pick "Uniform & Equal" as your reason — basically saying other similar houses near you are appraised lower, so yours should be too. Then you show up to a phone hearing with some comps and they usually knock it down.

The key thing is Uniform & Equal, not market value. You're not arguing what your house would sell for — you're saying "my neighbor's house is basically the same as mine and they're paying less." Way easier to prove.

I ended up using getovertaxed.com to pull my comps because I didn't feel like digging through HCAD's website for hours. $49 and they gave me everything I needed. But you can totally DIY it if you want to put in the time.

Deadline is May 15. Worst case nothing happens and your value stays the same. There's literally no downside.

**Title:** DFW people — are you protesting your property taxes this year?

Got my notice last week and yeah, it went up. Again. I'm in Dallas county but this applies to Collin, Tarrant, Denton, Rockwall — basically all of DFW.

For anyone who hasn't done this before: you can protest your appraised value every single year. The deadline is May 15 (or 30 days after your notice drops, whichever is later). You file with your county's appraisal district — DCAD, CCAD, TAD, whatever — most of them let you do it online now.

What you need is basically just comparable properties. Houses similar to yours that are valued lower. That's it. You bring that to an informal hearing (usually a phone call) and more often than not they'll reduce your value.

I used a site called getovertaxed.com for my comps — 49 bucks, got an evidence packet and cover letter. Saved me a few hours of research. But the main thing is just FILE. Don't let May 15 pass you by.

Anyone else been through the process? Curious what kind of reductions people are getting in DFW this year.

**Title:** Travis/Williamson county folks — protest your appraisal this year, seriously

I know everyone's tired of hearing about Austin home prices but here's the thing: if your appraised value went up, you don't have to just eat it. You file a protest and there's a decent chance they lower it.

Filed mine for the first time last year and kicked myself for not doing it sooner. The hearing was literally a 10 minute phone call. The appraiser pulled up my comps, agreed my value was high, and reduced it. That was it.

If you haven't done your homestead exemption either, do that first — that's a separate thing and it knocks $100K off your taxable value.

For the protest itself you need comparable properties valued lower than yours. I used getovertaxed.com ($49, they pull everything for you) but you can also dig through traviscad.org or wcad.org yourself. 

Deadline is May 15. Do it even if your value only went up a little — there's no penalty for protesting and it takes like 20 min to file.

**Title:** PSA for homeowners: you can protest your property tax appraisal every year and it takes like 20 minutes

I feel dumb for not knowing this until recently but you can literally challenge what your county says your house is worth. Every year. And if you win (which happens way more than you'd think) your property taxes go down.

In Texas the success rate is something like 60-80%. You basically find comparable homes near you that are valued lower than yours, file a protest, and have a phone call with an appraiser. That's the whole thing.

Even modest reductions add up. Getting $20K knocked off your appraised value might save you $500-600/year, which is $2,500-3,000 over 5 years. For 20 minutes of work.

The catch is there's a deadline — in TX it's May 15, other states vary. Look up your county appraisal district and check.

I built getovertaxed.com because I got frustrated doing the research manually, but you don't need any tool — just look up 3-5 similar homes in your area and compare their values to yours. If yours is higher, you have a case.

The key insight I wish someone told me earlier: the appraised value on your notice isn't final. It's a starting number. Treat it that way.

## r/realestate

**Title:** do you guys protest your property taxes every year?

Genuine question because I didn't until recently and it seems like most homeowners just... don't? Even though the success rate is wild.

Texas numbers for context:
- like 1.5 million protests filed per year
- 60-80% get a reduction
- average reduction is 20-40K in appraised value

The whole thing is just gathering comparable properties and making a case that your home is valued too high relative to similar ones. In Texas there's this thing called Uniform & Equal where you compare against other homes on the tax roll (not sales prices) which is usually easier to win.

I've been putting together evidence packets for people at getovertaxed.com ($49/property, covers TX and Cook County IL) and the amount of over-assessment I'm seeing is nuts. Like 30-40% of homes have a solid case for reduction.

Anyway — do you all protest? What's been your experience?

## Posting Notes
- Post from a real account with history, not a fresh one
- Don't post all 5 the same week — space them out over 2-3 weeks
- Spend time in the comments answering questions. That's where the real value is
- If someone calls it an ad, don't get defensive: "yeah I built the tool, but the advice about protesting is legit regardless"
- r/houston and r/dallas are the highest value — protest season is huge there
- r/personalfinance mods are strict about self-promo. Lead heavy with the advice, mention the site once at most
