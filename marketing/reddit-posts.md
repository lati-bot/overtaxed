**Title:** PSA: Harris County appraisal notices are hitting mailboxes — here's how to protest (step by step)

Hey Houston — it's that time of year. If your appraised value went up (again), you have until **May 15** to file a protest with HCAD. ~70% of people who protest get a reduction, so it's worth the 20 minutes.

**Quick steps:**
1. Go to hcad.org → iFile → file your protest online (select "Uniform & Equal" as your reason — NOT market value)
2. You'll need comparable properties that sold for less than your appraisal. HCAD's website has a property search, or you can pull comps from the MLS.
3. Show up to your informal hearing (or do it by phone/online). Bring your comps printed out.

**Pro tips:**
- "Uniform & Equal" compares your value to *similar homes already on the tax roll*, not market sales. It's usually stronger.
- You don't need to hire a law firm. The informal hearing is casual — it's just you and an appraiser looking at numbers.
- Even if you have a homestead exemption, you should still protest. They stack.

I built a tool at getovertaxed.com that pulls comparable properties automatically for $49 — evidence packet + cover letter ready to file. But honestly, even if you DIY it, just make sure you protest. The worst they can say is no, and your value stays the same.

Good luck out there 🤘

**Title:** DFW property tax notices are out — don't leave money on the table

Dallas, Collin, Denton, Tarrant, Rockwall — wherever you are, the deadline to protest is **May 15, 2026** (or 30 days after your notice, whichever is later).

If your appraised value jumped, here's what to do:

1. **File a protest** with your county appraisal district (DCAD, CCAD, DCAD-Denton, TAD, or RCAD). Most let you file online.
2. **Gather comps** — nearby properties with lower appraised values or recent sales below your appraisal.
3. **Attend the informal hearing** — phone or in-person. Bring your evidence. Be polite. Most reductions happen here.

**Choosing your protest reason:**
- **Uniform & Equal** = compare to similar homes on the tax roll (often better)
- **Market Value** = argue your home isn't worth what they say based on sales data

You don't need a $500 consultant for this. A few good comps and a clear presentation go a long way.

If you want the legwork done for you, I made getovertaxed.com — $49 for a comparable property analysis, evidence packet, and cover letter for any address in DFW. But the main thing is: **file your protest before May 15**.

**Title:** Travis/Williamson County tax notices are coming — protest guide for 2026

Austin homeowners: appraisal notices typically mail in April. If your value went up (and it probably did), you have until **May 15** to protest.

Here's the playbook:
1. File online at traviscad.org (Travis) or wcad.org (Williamson)
2. Select **Uniform & Equal** as your protest reason
3. Gather 3-5 comparable properties with lower values than yours
4. Attend the informal hearing — most reductions happen here without needing a formal hearing

**Austin-specific notes:**
- Travis County has been aggressive with valuations. Even modest homes are seeing 10-20% increases.
- If you haven't filed for your homestead exemption yet, do that too — it's separate from your protest and saves you $100K off your taxable value.
- The informal hearing is usually a 10-minute phone call. It's not adversarial.

I put together getovertaxed.com to generate evidence packets automatically ($49) — but honestly, the most important thing is just filing. Don't let the deadline pass.

**Title:** If you own a home, check if your property tax appraisal went up — protesting takes 20 min and saves hundreds

Most homeowners don't realize you can protest your property tax appraisal every year. In most states, the appraisal district sends you a notice of your home's appraised value, and you have a window (usually 30-60 days) to challenge it.

**Why bother?**
- Average savings from a successful protest: $500-1,500/year depending on your area
- Success rates are surprisingly high (60-80% in many Texas counties)
- The downside is literally zero — your value can't go UP from protesting

**How it works:**
1. Get your appraisal notice (check your county appraisal district website)
2. File a protest before the deadline
3. Gather comparable properties that support a lower value
4. Attend an informal hearing (usually by phone)

**What makes a strong case:**
- Comparable properties nearby with lower appraised values ("Uniform & Equal")
- Recent sales in your area below your appraised value
- Any condition issues with your property (repairs needed, etc.)

This applies to Texas, Illinois, and many other states. Check your local appraisal district for deadlines.

I'm building tools to make this easier at getovertaxed.com (currently covers TX and Cook County, IL), but regardless of what tools you use, the key insight is: **the appraisal district's value is a starting offer, not a final answer.**

**Title:** Property tax protests: underrated strategy that most homeowners skip

Quick PSA for homeowners — property tax protest season is coming up in most states. If you're not protesting your appraisal annually, you're probably overpaying.

Some stats from Texas (one of the most protest-friendly states):
- ~1.5M protests filed annually
- 60-80% result in a reduction
- Average reduction: $20,000-40,000 in appraised value
- That's $500-1,200+ in real tax savings per year

The key is **comparable evidence**. You need 3-5 properties similar to yours with lower values. Two approaches:
- **Market Value**: recent sales below your appraised value
- **Uniform & Equal**: similar homes on the tax roll appraised lower than yours (Texas-specific, but powerful)

Most people think they need to hire a consultant or attorney. For informal hearings, you really don't. It's a conversation with an appraiser, not a courtroom.

If you're in Texas or Cook County, IL — I've been building getovertaxed.com to automate the evidence gathering ($49 per property). But the main takeaway: file your protest every year, even if your value didn't go up much. It's free to file and the worst outcome is no change.

*Notes for Tomi:*
- Adjust timing based on when notices actually mail (late March for Houston, April for most others)
- Consider posting from a personal account, not a brand account — Reddit hates self-promo
- Engage genuinely in comments, answer questions, don't just link-drop
- Could also post in r/RealEstate, r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer, r/tax
- Each subreddit has different self-promo rules — check before posting
