## Template 1: The Helpful Neighbor (Best for Cold Markets)

**Subject:** Got your property tax notice? Here's what I did.

Just got my 2026 appraisal notice and it went up again 🙄 

I found a site that compares your home's assessed value against similar properties in your neighborhood and builds an appeal packet for you. It's $49 (flat fee, not a percentage like those big companies).

It took me like 5 minutes — you search your address, see if you're over-assessed, and if so they give you everything you need to file a protest: evidence packet with comps, a cover letter, and step-by-step instructions.

Website is getovertaxed.com if anyone wants to check. They cover [COUNTY NAME] and the deadline is May 15.

Has anyone else protested before? Curious how it went.

## Template 2: The Tax Season PSA

**Subject:** Reminder: May 15 deadline to protest your property taxes

Hey neighbors — friendly reminder that if your 2026 appraisal went up, you have until **May 15** to file a protest with [CAD NAME].

Most people don't realize you can do this yourself — you don't need a lawyer or one of those companies that take 30-40% of your savings.

I used getovertaxed.com to pull together my evidence. $49 flat fee, they compare your home against similar properties and build the whole packet. Took a few minutes.

Even if you only save $500/year, that's $2,500+ over 5 years. Worth a shot.

## Template 3: The Question Format (High Engagement)

**Subject:** Anyone protested their property taxes in [COUNTY]?

My appraisal jumped this year and I'm thinking about filing a protest. Has anyone in [NEIGHBORHOOD] done it before?

I've been looking into it and found that most homes in our area are assessed higher than comparable properties. There's a site (getovertaxed.com) that shows you the comparison for free — you only pay $49 if you want the full appeal packet.

Would love to hear from anyone who's been through the process. Worth it?

## Template 4: The Results Post (Use After You Have Testimonials)

**Subject:** Saved $[X] on property taxes — here's how

Just got my protest results back and they lowered my assessed value by $[X]! That's about $[Y]/year in tax savings.

The whole process took maybe 30 minutes total:
1. Got my evidence packet from getovertaxed.com ($49)
2. Filed online through [CAD portal]
3. Got the reduction without even going to a hearing

If your appraisal went up this year, definitely worth looking into. Deadline is May 15.

- Best ROI: post Template 1 in 2-3 neighborhoods, wait for comments, then post Template 3 a week later in different ones
