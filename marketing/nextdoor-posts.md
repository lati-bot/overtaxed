## Template 1: The "just discovered this" post

**Subject:** Got your property tax notice? Mine went up again

Opened my mail yesterday and of course my appraisal went up. Happens every year right?

Looked into it and apparently you can protest it — and most people who do actually get a reduction? Wish I knew this years ago.

I ended up using this site getovertaxed.com that compares your house against similar ones nearby. If you're over-assessed it puts together an appeal packet for you. Cost me $49 which felt worth it vs spending a weekend researching comps myself.

Deadline to file is May 15 with [CAD NAME]. Has anyone here done this before? Trying to figure out if it's worth going to the hearing or if the phone option works fine.

## Template 2: The deadline reminder

**Subject:** May 15 deadline to protest property taxes — don't miss it

Just a heads up for anyone whose appraisal went up this year — you have until May 15 to file a protest with [CAD NAME].

You don't need to hire those companies that take a percentage of your savings. You can do it yourself or use something like getovertaxed.com ($49 flat fee, they pull all the comparable properties for you).

Even saving $500/year adds up to $2,500+ over 5 years. Takes maybe 20 minutes to file.

## Template 3: The question

**Subject:** Has anyone protested their property taxes here?

Thinking about protesting my appraisal this year. Value jumped and it doesn't feel right compared to other houses on my street.

Found a site that lets you check for free if you're over-assessed (getovertaxed.com) — you only pay if you want the full evidence packet.

Anyone been through the process in [COUNTY]? Trying to decide if it's worth it or if they just deny everyone.

## Template 4: After you have real results

**Subject:** Protested my property taxes and it actually worked

Got my results back — they lowered my value by $[X]. That's like $[Y] less in taxes per year.

Whole thing was way less painful than I expected:
- Got my evidence from getovertaxed.com ($49)
- Filed online through [CAD portal]  
- Did the hearing over the phone, took 10 minutes

If your appraisal went up this year, seriously just do it. May 15 deadline.
