## 1. How Professional Appraisers Select Comps

### USPAP Standards

The Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) governs appraisal methodology in the US. Key principles:

- **Standards Rule 1-4(a)**: "When a sales comparison approach is necessary for credible assignment results, an appraiser must analyze such comparable sales data as are available to indicate a value conclusion."
- **USPAP does NOT mandate specific methodologies** — it requires appraisers to be aware of, understand, and correctly employ recognized methods and techniques.
- **Three approaches** are recognized: Sales Comparison, Income, and Cost.
- **Sales Comparison** is the primary approach for residential property.
- Texas Property Tax Code §23.01 requires appraisal districts to comply with USPAP when using mass appraisal.

### IAAO Standards (Mass Appraisal)

The International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO) Standard on Mass Appraisal of Real Property provides the framework CADs use:

- **Comparable sales algorithms** are most akin to single-property appraisal applications.
- They have the advantage of being "familiar and easily explained."
- Models are used only to make adjustments to selected comparables.
- The **sales comparison approach is the best approach** for single-family residential property, including condominiums.
- Selection criteria for comparables in mass appraisal: **location (neighborhood/market area), property type, size, age, quality, and condition**.

### Texas Comptroller / PTAD Recommendations

- CADs are required to use USPAP-compliant mass appraisal methods.
- Properties must be valued at market value as of January 1 of the tax year.
- The Comptroller conducts **ratio studies** to measure uniformity of appraisals across districts.
- CADs use **Computer-Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA)** systems that group properties by neighborhood codes and apply market-derived adjustments for property characteristics.

### Standard Adjustment Factors Used by Appraisers

Professional (fee) appraisers and CADs typically adjust for:
1. **Location** (neighborhood/proximity)
2. **Size** (gross living area / square footage)
3. **Age** (year built / effective age)
4. **Quality/Class** (construction quality rating)
5. **Condition** (CDU - Condition, Desirability, Utility)
6. **Lot size** (land area)
7. **Features** (pool, garage bays, bedrooms, bathrooms)
8. **Time of sale** (market conditions adjustment for sales comps)

## 2. How Professional Protest Firms Select Comps

### O'Connor & Associates

O'Connor is the largest Texas property tax protest firm ($213M saved for clients in 2025). Their methodology:

- **Dual-approach**: They present both market value (§41.43) and uniform & equal (§42.26) arguments.
- **Equity approach (their strong suit)**: Gather assessment comparables from the same tax roll, make adjustments for size and age, calculate median adjusted $/sqft, multiply by subject's living area.
- **Recommended 3-10 comps** for equity analysis: "Most presentations on equity use five to ten comparables."
- **Adjustments are optional**: "In some cases the owners may elect not to make adjustments... appraisal district staff and appraisal review board members can make their own determinations about which comparables are most appropriate."
- **Prioritize similarity**: "Select comparables which are best suited for the analysis" when many are available.
- **Aggressive multi-level strategy**: Informal → ARB → Binding Arbitration → Judicial Appeal, on both market value AND equity.

### SquareDeal.tax

SquareDeal is a DIY evidence platform (direct competitor to Overtaxed). Their methodology:

- **Same neighborhood code** is the primary filter.
- **5-10 equity comps** are standard in their reports.
- Comps must match: **year built (±10 years), living area (close range), construction quality rating, CDU rating, proximity (within ~1 mile)**.
- **Adjustments made for**: sqft of improvements, sqft of land, CDU rating (using published adjustment factor tables).
- **Median adjusted $/sqft** is the target metric.
- They show adjusted values: "Calculate the net adjusted value per square foot for the comp. Now find the adjusted value of the comp if it were applied to the subject."
- **80% success rate** claimed (2024: 80% of users who used their comps evidence got a reduction).

### Ownwell

Ownwell operates as a full-service protest firm using data analytics:
- They analyze year-over-year market values across counties.
- Technology-driven comp selection at scale.
- Contingency fee model (only pay if they save you money).

### Common Patterns Across Firms

| Factor | Priority | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Same neighborhood code | **Critical** | First filter for all firms |
| Similar size (sqft) | **High** | Within 10-20% of subject |
| Similar age (year built) | **High** | Within 5-10 years |
| Similar quality/class | **High** | Same construction quality rating |
| Proximity | **High** | Within 0.5-1 mile ideal |
| Similar condition (CDU) | **Medium** | Same or similar CDU rating |
| Similar lot size | **Medium** | Especially for land equity |
| Beds/baths | **Low-Medium** | Less critical than sqft/age |
| Pool/garage | **Low-Medium** | Used as adjustment factor, not filter |

## 3. What Makes a Comp "Defensible" at an ARB Hearing

### What ARB Members Look For

Based on ARB training materials and CAD evidence guidelines:

1. **Same neighborhood code or market area** — This is the #1 credibility factor. Texas Tax Code §42.26(a)(3) explicitly references "comparable properties" in the same area.
2. **Similar physical characteristics** — Size, age, quality, condition.
3. **Adjustments that make sense** — "Appropriate adjustments" is the statutory language.
4. **Reasonable number** — The law says "a reasonable number of comparable properties." In practice: 3 minimum, 5-10 ideal.
5. **Current data** — For equity comps: current tax year values. For sales comps: sales within last 6-12 months.

### What Makes an Appraiser Dismiss a Comp

From SquareDeal's blog on defending comps and practitioner forums:

- **Vague dismissals**: "Your comps are not good" — counter by asking for specifics.
- **"These aren't sales comps"** — Invalid reason for dismissal if you filed for unequal appraisal under §42.26.
- **Different neighborhood** — Strongest basis for dismissal.
- **Very different size** — More than 25-30% difference is easily challenged.
- **Different property type/class** — e.g., comparing a single-family to a condo.
- **Outdated sales** — Sales older than 12-18 months.

### Avoiding "Cherry-Picking" Accusations

This is the most important credibility challenge. Strategies:

1. **Use the same neighborhood code** — Shows you're comparing apples to apples.
2. **Show you selected from a broad pool** — "I analyzed X properties in the neighborhood and selected the Y most comparable."
3. **Use comps that also appear in the CAD's own evidence** — "Some of the comps I've used are also in the CAD's own evidence grid."
4. **Apply adjustments** — Adjustments show methodological rigor, not cherry-picking.
5. **Don't exclude comps that hurt your case without explanation** — If there's a good reason a property isn't comparable, explain it.
6. **Use the median, not the lowest value** — Proposing the median of adjusted comps is inherently reasonable.
7. **Show quantity AND quality** — 5-10 comps from the same neighborhood is hard to dismiss as cherry-picked.

## 4. Comp Adjustment Methodologies

### How Adjustments Work

The principle: **adjust the comparable TO the subject**. If a comp has a feature the subject doesn't have, adjust the comp's value DOWN. If the subject has a feature the comp doesn't, adjust the comp's value UP.

### Standard Adjustment Amounts (Texas Residential)

**Important caveat**: Adjustments are market-specific and price-tier-specific. A pool adjustment in a $200K neighborhood differs from a $600K neighborhood. These are general ranges observed in Texas practice.

#### Size (Gross Living Area / Square Footage)

- **NOT the same as price per square foot** — This is the most common mistake.
- Professional appraisers use roughly **30-50% of the area's average $/sqft** as the GLA adjustment factor.
- Example: If area average is $150/sqft, GLA adjustment might be $45-75/sqft.
- **Typical ranges in Texas**:
  - Low-end homes ($100-200K): $30-60/sqft
  - Mid-range homes ($200-400K): $50-100/sqft
  - High-end homes ($400K+): $75-150/sqft
- **Diminishing returns**: Larger differences yield smaller per-sqft adjustments.
- For tax protest equity comps, many firms simply use $/sqft as the normalization metric (adjusting by ratio, not dollar amount).

#### Age (Year Built)

- CADs typically use an **effective age depreciation factor**.
- Bell CAD uses a "% Good Adjustment" — the difference in remaining useful life between subject and comp.
- **Rough rule of thumb**: 0.5-1.5% of improvement value per year of age difference.
- For a $300K house, that's roughly $1,500-4,500 per year of age difference.
- Newer homes depreciate more in early years; older homes stabilize.
- **For equity comps**: Keep comps within ±10 years of subject to minimize this adjustment.

#### Pool

- **Typical Texas adjustment**: $10,000-30,000 depending on type and price tier.
- In-ground gunite pool: $15,000-30,000
- Above-ground or small pool: $5,000-15,000
- **Pools add less value than they cost to build** — generally 30-50% of construction cost.
- Many mass appraisal systems add a specific flat amount for pools.

#### Garage

- **Per bay**: $3,000-15,000 depending on price tier.
  - Low-end homes: $3,000-5,000/bay
  - Mid-range homes: $5,000-10,000/bay
  - High-end homes: $8,000-15,000/bay
- Attached vs detached matters.
- Carport vs enclosed garage matters.

#### Bedrooms

- **Varies widely by market segment**.
- In many markets, bedroom count has minimal impact once sqft is controlled for.
- Low-end homes: $0-3,000 per bedroom
- Mid-range homes: $3,000-8,000 per bedroom
- Sometimes no adjustment is needed if sqft already accounts for it.

#### Bathrooms

- Full bath: $4,000-15,000 depending on price tier.
- Half bath: $2,000-8,000.
- Low-end homes: $4,000 per full bath
- Mid-range homes: $5,000-10,000 per full bath

#### Condition (CDU)

- CDU adjustments are multiplicative, not additive.
- Each CDU grade step (e.g., Average → Good) typically represents 5-15% of improvement value.
- SquareDeal publishes CDU adjustment factor tables for each county.

#### Lot Size

- Varies enormously by area.
- Urban/suburban: May be $2-10/sqft of lot area difference.
- CADs typically have separate land valuations that can be compared directly.

#### Construction Quality/Class

- Each grade step (e.g., C to C+ or Average to Above Average) is typically 5-15% of improvement value.
- This is one of the more significant adjustments.

### Adjustment Methodology for Equity Comps (Tax Protests)

The practical approach used by most protest firms:

1. **Start with properties in the same neighborhood code.**
2. **Calculate $/sqft of appraised value** for each potential comp.
3. **Filter for similar**: age (±10 yr), size (±20%), quality (same or adjacent grade), CDU (same or adjacent).
4. **Make adjustments for remaining differences** (primarily age and quality if different).
5. **Calculate adjusted $/sqft** for each comp.
6. **Take the median** of adjusted $/sqft values.
7. **Multiply median $/sqft × subject's living area** = proposed value.

## 5. Equity Comps vs Sales Comps — Different Selection Criteria

### §42.26 Equity / Uniform & Equal (Appraisal Comps)

**Legal basis**: Texas Tax Code §42.26(a)(3) — "the appraised value of the property exceeds the median appraised value of a reasonable number of comparable properties appropriately adjusted."

**Selection criteria**:
- Comps come from the **same tax roll** (current year appraised values)
- **Same neighborhood code** is critical — this is the CAD's own grouping
- No sale date needed — you're comparing appraisals, not sales
- **All properties in the neighborhood are candidates** — you have a large pool
- Adjustments are to appraised values, not sale prices
- Must use **current year values** (the year you're protesting)

**Advantages**:
- Huge pool of potential comps (every property in the neighborhood)
- Publicly available data from CAD websites
- No MLS access or realtor needed
- Texas is a non-disclosure state, so sales data is hard to get — equity comps don't require it
- Value cannot be raised during judicial appeal on equity (only upside, no downside)
- Even if market value supports a higher assessment, equity can still win

**This is the bread-and-butter of DIY protests and most protest firms.**

### §41.43 Market Value (Sales Comps)

**Legal basis**: Texas Tax Code §41.43(b)(3) — protest based on market value.

**Selection criteria**:
- Comps are **recent sales** of similar properties
- Sales within **6-12 months** of the January 1 assessment date
- **Proximity**: within 0.5-1 mile ideally
- Must match: size, age, condition, features
- Adjustments include **time of sale** (market conditions) adjustment
- Requires actual sale prices — hard to get in Texas (non-disclosure state)

**Key difference**: You need **sale prices**, which in Texas are NOT public record. Sources:
- MLS data (requires a realtor)
- CAD's own sales data (they collect deed recordings and surveys)
- Third-party data vendors
- The CAD's evidence packet (they must share it 14 days before hearing)

### Practical Implication for Overtaxed

**Equity comps should be the primary approach** because:
1. Data is publicly available from CAD websites
2. No MLS/realtor dependency
3. Larger pool of potential comps
4. Legally defensible under §42.26
5. Most protest outcomes are determined by equity analysis
6. Sales comps can supplement but are harder to obtain at scale

---

## 6. Neighborhood Code / Subdivision

### Do ARBs Require Same Neighborhood Code?

- **Not legally required**, but **strongly preferred**.
- §42.26 references "comparable properties" but doesn't define geographic boundary.
- In practice, **same neighborhood code is the gold standard** for equity comps.
- SquareDeal: "Typically, they should bear the same neighborhood code."
- CADs organize their own evidence by neighborhood code.
- Using comps from the same neighborhood code makes it very hard for the CAD to argue your comps are invalid — they're using the same grouping.

### Can You Use Adjacent Neighborhoods?

- **Yes, but explain why**.
- Valid reasons: subject's neighborhood is too small, adjacent neighborhood has identical housing stock (same builder, same era, same style).
- Stronger when neighborhoods are in the same school district and similar market area.
- SquareDeal: "If you don't find enough properties in your neighborhood code, you can expand your search to your entire school district."
- Major boundaries to avoid crossing: highways, rivers, railroad tracks, school district lines.

### What if the Neighborhood is Too Small?

- Use whatever comps exist in the neighborhood, then supplement with adjacent.
- Explain the expansion: "The subject's neighborhood code contains only X properties, requiring expansion to adjacent neighborhoods with similar characteristics."
- Consider whether the small neighborhood is actually a custom/unique area — if so, fewer comps may be acceptable.
- For very small neighborhoods (<20 properties), 3-5 comps may be all that's available, and that's fine.

## 7. The "Best Comp" vs "Most Comps" Debate

### Quality vs Quantity

The consensus from professional sources:

| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| Minimum comps | **3** (both legal and practical minimum) |
| Sweet spot | **5-10** comps (most common across all professional firms) |
| Maximum useful | **10-15** (beyond this, diminishing returns / ARB fatigue) |
| Too many | **20+** risks overwhelming and diluting the case |

### What the Professionals Say

- **O'Connor**: "Most presentations on equity use five to ten comparables."
- **SquareDeal**: Uses 5-10 comps in their standard reports; "Pick a set of five comparable properties."
- **TexasPVP**: "Aim for 3-5 comps to balance thoroughness and clarity."
- **Texas A&M TRERC**: Focus on quality of evidence, keep it concise.
- **Bell CAD training**: "Typically, a [grid] will include at least three comparable [properties], sometimes more."

### The Real Answer

**5 well-chosen, properly adjusted comps from the same neighborhood beats 20 loosely-related ones.**

But there's nuance:
- **For equity protests**: 5-10 is ideal. You need enough to establish a pattern (the median is meaningful) but not so many that you're including weak comps.
- **For sales comps**: 3-5 is typical because recent, proximate sales are harder to find.
- **ARBs have limited time** (15 minutes for the whole hearing). They can't review 20 comps.
- **The median of more comps is more defensible** — harder to accuse of cherry-picking.
- **Statistically, 5+ gives a meaningful median**. 3 is the bare minimum.

### Recommendation for Overtaxed

**Target 5-10 equity comps** per property:
- Start with all properties in the same neighborhood code
- Filter for similarity (size ±20%, age ±10yr, same quality class)
- Sort by adjusted $/sqft
- Select the 5-10 best matches (those that support reduction while being genuinely comparable)
- Always include the median, which should be below the subject's appraised value

## 8. Comp Selection with Incomplete Data

### Rockwall County: No Square Footage

**Challenge**: Can't calculate $/sqft, which is the core metric for equity comps.

**Approaches**:
- **Use total appraised value** as the comparison metric instead of $/sqft.
- **Adjust by other available factors**: lot size, age, bedroom count, bathroom count.
- **Group by value range**: Find properties in the same neighborhood with similar total appraised values.
- **If improvement sqft is missing but building count and bedroom count are available**, use those as proxies for size.
- **Cross-reference with county GIS data** — some counties have parcel maps with building footprints.
- **Use land-only equity analysis** as an alternative — compare land values per acre/sqft.

**Impact**: Without sqft, comp selection is weaker but still viable. Value-based comparison with age/bedroom adjustments can work.

### Williamson County: No Year Built

**Challenge**: Can't adjust for age, which is a significant value factor.

**Approaches**:
- **Filter by subdivision** — most subdivisions were built within a narrow timeframe, so subdivision effectively controls for age.
- **Use other available proxies**: effective year, depreciation percentage (if available).
- **If neighborhood code groups similar-era homes**, age differences within a neighborhood should be small.
- **Omit age adjustment** and rely on neighborhood + size + quality matching.

### Harris/Tarrant/Denton: No Beds/Baths

**Challenge**: Can't filter or adjust by bedroom/bathroom count.

**Impact**: **Relatively minor**. Beds/baths matter less than sqft, age, and quality for comp selection. Here's why:
- Beds/baths are highly correlated with sqft — a 2,500 sqft home almost always has 3-4 beds and 2-3 baths.
- Professional appraisers often find bedroom count has minimal marginal impact once sqft is controlled.
- For equity comps, the CAD's own grids in these counties also don't use beds/baths as a primary factor.
- **Bottom line**: If you have sqft, age, quality, and neighborhood code — you're fine without beds/baths.

### General Strategy for Incomplete Data

1. **Use whatever you have** — some comp analysis is better than none.
2. **Lean harder on the factors you DO have** — if no sqft, emphasize value range + age + neighborhood.
3. **Reduce the number of adjustments** — fewer adjustments = fewer things to challenge.
4. **Use unadjusted comps** when data is very limited — O'Connor notes that "in some cases appraisers and ARB panels are more comfortable with unadjusted data."
5. **Explain data limitations** — transparency builds credibility.

## 9. Red Flags That Get Comps Thrown Out

### Distance

- **Safe zone**: Same neighborhood code / within 0.5 mile
- **Acceptable with explanation**: 0.5-1 mile
- **Risky**: 1-3 miles (must explain why)
- **Likely dismissed**: 3+ miles (unless rural)
- Major dividers (highways, railroad, school district boundary) can invalidate even close comps.

### Size Difference

- **Safe zone**: Within ±10% of subject's sqft
- **Acceptable**: Within ±20%
- **Risky**: ±20-30% (must adjust heavily)
- **Likely dismissed**: >30% different (a 1,500 sqft comp for a 2,500 sqft subject is weak)

### Property Class / Type

- **Must match**: Single-family to single-family, condo to condo, etc.
- Comparing a single-story ranch to a two-story is acceptable with adjustment.
- Comparing a traditional to a townhome: risky.
- Different property class codes (A1 vs B1) will be challenged.

### Distressed Sales

- Foreclosures, short sales, REO sales are typically excluded from sales comp analysis.
- ARM's length transactions only for market value protests.
- For equity comps, this doesn't apply (you're comparing appraisals, not sales).

### Recent Renovations / Remodeling

- A recently remodeled comp may be inappropriate if subject is original condition.
- CAD may have updated the comp's value to reflect renovations.
- If using as a comp, adjust downward for the renovation premium.
- Check condition/CDU ratings — a remodeled comp should show a higher CDU.

### Lot Size

- Significant lot size differences can be grounds for dismissal.
- A comp on a 0.1-acre lot vs subject on a 0.5-acre lot needs a large land adjustment.
- For equity comps, land value adjustments should be made explicitly.

### Age Difference

- **Safe zone**: Within ±5 years
- **Acceptable**: Within ±10 years
- **Risky**: ±10-20 years
- **Likely dismissed**: >20 years different

### Other Red Flags

- **Comps with value reductions in progress** — if a comp already received a reduction, its current value may be artificially low.
- **Non-arm's-length transactions** — family sales, entity transfers, partial interest sales.
- **Comps from a different school district** — different demand characteristics.
- **New construction comps** for older homes (or vice versa) — different market segment.

## 10. What to Show in the Evidence Packet

### Professional Firm Standards

Based on Bell CAD's published grid examples, SquareDeal's reports, and O'Connor's methodology:

#### Equity Grid (Primary Evidence)

Show for each comp:
- **Property ID / Account number**
- **Situs address**
- **Neighborhood code** (same as subject)
- **Year built**
- **Living area (sqft)**
- **Quality/Class rating**
- **Condition (CDU)** if available
- **Land value**
- **Improvement value**
- **Total appraised (market) value**
- **Appraised value per sqft**
- **Adjustments** (itemized: age, size, quality, land, features)
- **Net adjustment amount**
- **Indicated value** (appraised value ± adjustments)
- **Indicated value per sqft**

At the bottom:
- **Median adjusted value per sqft**
- **Median indicated value for the subject**
- **Subject's current appraised value** (for comparison)
- **Proposed value** (= median indicated value)

#### Sales Grid (If Available)

Same as equity grid but replace appraised values with:
- **Sale price**
- **Sale date**
- **Time adjustment** (market conditions)
- **Adjusted sale price**

#### Supporting Materials

- **Map** showing subject and comps' locations (proximity)
- **Photos** of subject property showing condition issues
- **Repair estimates** if applicable
- **Subject property record card** (with any errors highlighted)

### Should You Show Adjustments?

**Yes, always show adjustments.** This is the clear consensus:

- The Texas Tax Code says "appropriately adjusted" — showing adjustments demonstrates compliance.
- Bell CAD and Grayson CAD both publish equity grid templates with explicit adjustment columns.
- SquareDeal shows adjustments in their standard reports.
- O'Connor: "Making adjustments complies more strictly with the Texas Property Tax Code."
- Showing adjustments counters cherry-picking accusations — it shows you're accounting for differences.

**However**, O'Connor also notes: "in some cases appraisers and ARB panels are more comfortable with unadjusted data" — this is when comps are very similar and adjustments are minimal. If your comps are excellent matches, you can show unadjusted data alongside adjusted.

### Even With Missing Data?

- **Show what you have** — leave fields blank rather than omitting them.
- **Be transparent**: "Year built data not available from [County] CAD" is better than hiding the column.
- **If a field is missing for ALL properties** (including subject), it's fine to omit that column entirely.
- **Don't make up data** — fabricated data destroys credibility.

## 11. Recommendations for Overtaxed

### Improving Our Current Approach

Our current approach (same neighborhood, similar value, sort by $/sqft to median, pick 5-10) is a reasonable starting point but can be significantly improved:

#### Priority 1: Multi-Factor Similarity Scoring

Replace the single-dimension "value range" filter with a **weighted similarity score**:

```
similarity_score = 
  w1 × (1 - |sqft_diff| / subject_sqft)  +  // Size match
  w2 × (1 - |age_diff| / 30)              +  // Age match (cap at 30yr diff)
  w3 × quality_match                       +  // Same quality class = 1, adjacent = 0.7, etc.
  w4 × cdu_match                           +  // Same CDU = 1, adjacent = 0.7, etc.
  w5 × (1 - distance / max_distance)       +  // Proximity
  w6 × lot_size_match                         // Similar lot size
```

**Suggested weights**:
- Size (sqft): 25%
- Age: 20%
- Quality/Class: 20%
- Proximity/Neighborhood: 15%
- Condition (CDU): 10%
- Lot size: 10%

#### Priority 2: Apply Adjustments

Don't just pick low-$/sqft comps — **adjust** them:

1. For each comp, calculate adjustments for differences from subject (size, age, quality, CDU, lot).
2. Calculate the **adjusted value** for each comp.
3. The proposed value is the **median of adjusted values**.
4. This is exactly what the law says: "median appraised value of a reasonable number of comparable properties appropriately adjusted."

#### Priority 3: Dual Evidence (Equity + Sales)

- **Primary**: Equity comp grid (current year appraised values) — this is what we can do at scale.
- **Secondary**: If we can source sales data, add a sales comp grid.
- Both grids should follow the Bell CAD / standard Texas format.

#### Priority 4: County-Specific Logic

Handle data gaps by county:
- **Rockwall (no sqft)**: Use total value comparison with age/bedroom adjustments. Consider fetching sqft from other sources.
- **Williamson (no year built)**: Rely on subdivision as age proxy. Filter by subdivision code.
- **Harris/Tarrant/Denton (no beds/baths)**: No problem — focus on sqft, age, quality.
- **Counties with full data**: Use the full similarity scoring algorithm.

#### Priority 5: Evidence Presentation

Generate evidence packets that include:
1. **Summary page**: Subject property info, proposed value, estimated savings.
2. **Equity comp grid**: All fields, adjustments shown, median calculated.
3. **Map**: Subject and comps plotted (visual proximity proof).
4. **Key highlights**: Same neighborhood code, year built range, sqft range, quality match.
5. **How to present**: Brief talking points for the 5-7 minute presentation window.

### Comp Selection Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```
function selectComps(subject, allProperties):
  // Step 1: Same neighborhood code
  candidates = allProperties.filter(p => p.neighborhood == subject.neighborhood)
  
  // Step 2: Basic filters
  candidates = candidates.filter(p => 
    p.propertyType == subject.propertyType AND
    abs(p.sqft - subject.sqft) / subject.sqft <= 0.25 AND  // within 25%
    abs(p.yearBuilt - subject.yearBuilt) <= 15 AND         // within 15 years
    p.id != subject.id
  )
  
  // Step 3: Calculate similarity score for each
  for each candidate:
    candidate.similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(subject, candidate)
    candidate.adjustments = calculateAdjustments(subject, candidate)
    candidate.adjustedValue = candidate.appraisedValue + sum(candidate.adjustments)
    candidate.adjustedPerSqft = candidate.adjustedValue / subject.sqft
  
  // Step 4: Sort by similarity score (best matches first)
  candidates.sortByDescending(c => c.similarityScore)
  
  // Step 5: Select top 5-10, preferring those with adjusted value below subject
  // But don't exclusively pick low values (avoid cherry-picking appearance)
  selected = selectBalanced(candidates, targetCount=7)
  
  // Step 6: Calculate proposed value
  medianAdjustedPerSqft = median(selected.map(c => c.adjustedPerSqft))
  proposedValue = medianAdjustedPerSqft * subject.sqft
  
  return { comps: selected, proposedValue, medianPerSqft: medianAdjustedPerSqft }
```

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Comp similarity score distribution**: Are our comps genuinely similar?
- **Adjustment magnitude**: Large adjustments (>15% of value) weaken the comp.
- **Median vs subject spread**: How much lower is our proposed value?
- **Protest success rate**: By county, by comp quality.
- **ARB acceptance rate**: Do our comps survive hearing challenges?
