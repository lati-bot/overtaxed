## PANEL 1: Content/Legal Panel

**Participants:**
- **Maria Torres** — IL Property Tax Attorney, 22 years Cook County practice
- **David Kim** — Former Cook County Assessor's Office analyst (2015–2022)
- **Robert Hayes** — Retired Board of Review hearing officer (18 years)
- **Sandra Chen** — Owner, Midwest Tax Appeals Inc. (5,500+ appeals/year in Cook County)

### Q1: Is the Assessor appeal a "free lottery ticket"? Realistic success rate vs BOR?

**Sandra:** I'd push back on "lottery ticket." We get reductions at the Assessor level on maybe 30–35% of residential filings. It's not random — they have an algorithm. If your property is clearly over-assessed relative to the neighborhood median, their system flags it and an analyst adjusts it. But the reductions tend to be modest — 5–10% typically.

**David:** Sandra's right about the algorithm. When I was there, we processed thousands of appeals a day during peak township windows. The reality is, if the data clearly supports a reduction, you'll get one. The Assessor's Office *wants* to get it right — every appeal that gets resolved at our level is one fewer for BOR. But we weren't doing deep dives. If your case requires judgment — unusual property, bad comps in the area — it's going to pass through unchanged.

**Maria:** I tell every client: file at both levels, period. The Assessor appeal costs nothing, takes 15 minutes online, and even a small reduction compounds. If you get a 5% cut at Assessor and another 10% at BOR, that's better than skipping to BOR alone. The success rate at BOR is higher — I'd say 50–60% of filed appeals get some reduction — but that doesn't mean you skip step one.

**Robert:** From the BOR side, I'd agree the success rates are higher with us, partly because we have hearings and the process is more deliberative. But Maria's math is right. They're additive, not substitutive. The Assessor might get you from $350K to $330K, then BOR might get you to $305K. You'd never get to $305K at BOR alone because BOR is reviewing the *post-Assessor* value.

**Sandra:** That's the critical point people miss. BOR reviews whatever value exists after the Assessor decision. So if the Assessor already knocked it down, BOR is starting from a lower number. Two bites really does mean two bites.

### Q2: Does filing with the Assessor help or hurt your BOR case?

**Robert:** I need to be clear: BOR commissioners do NOT see your Assessor-level filing. We review the property fresh. We see the current assessed value — which reflects any Assessor adjustment — but not your arguments or evidence from that level.

**David:** Correct. The systems are separate. The Assessor's Office doesn't transmit appeal records to BOR.

**Maria:** This is one of the biggest myths I fight. Homeowners think "if the Assessor rejected me, BOR will think my case is weak." No. BOR doesn't know you filed with the Assessor unless you tell them. And even if you mention it, they don't care. They do their own analysis.

**Sandra:** The only scenario where Assessor-level could theoretically "hurt" is if the Assessor *raises* your assessment — but that essentially never happens on an appeal. Worst case is no change. So there's genuinely zero downside.

**Robert:** One nuance: if the Assessor *did* grant a significant reduction, BOR may be less inclined to reduce further because the number already looks more reasonable. But that's not "hurting" — that's just the math of a lower starting point.

### Q3: What evidence actually wins at each level? Same or different?

**David:** At the Assessor level, it's almost entirely data-driven. We looked at: comparable sales, comparable assessments (uniformity), and property characteristics. If you submitted a PDF with five solid comps showing lower assessed values per square foot, that's what moved the needle. We didn't read narrative arguments. We didn't look at photos much.

**Sandra:** This is where I disagree slightly. For the Assessor portal, you're filling in structured fields — PINs of comparable properties, sale prices, your arguments about square footage or condition. It's a form, not a brief. So the "evidence" is really the comp selection. At BOR, you can submit a more complete packet — narrative, photos, a full uniformity analysis, even appraisals.

**Maria:** The core evidence is the same: comps and uniformity data. But the *presentation* differs. Assessor level = fill in the form with your best 5 comps. BOR level = submit a polished evidence packet. The underlying data — recent sales, assessment comparisons — is identical.

**Robert:** At BOR, what impressed me most was a clear uniformity argument. "Here are 10 properties within half a mile, same style, same age range, same bedroom count. Their median assessed value per square foot is $X. My property is assessed at $Y per square foot, which is Z% higher." That's compelling. Sale price comps are good too, but uniformity is the bread and butter of Cook County appeals.

**Sandra:** Agreed. And here's the thing for a $49 product — the comps and uniformity analysis you'd generate work for BOTH levels. You don't need different evidence. You need different *filing instructions*.

### Q4: Non-reassessment year properties — should they bother with Assessor?

**David:** Yes, absolutely. The Assessor accepts appeals every year for every township, reassessment year or not. In non-reassessment years, values carry forward with an equalization factor applied, but you can still argue the underlying assessment is wrong.

**Maria:** The calculus changes slightly though. In a reassessment year, values move a lot — sometimes 20-40% — so there are more clear errors and more room for reduction. In non-reassessment years, values are more "baked in" and the Assessor is less likely to override. Success rates at the Assessor level in off-years are probably 15–20% vs 30–35% in reassessment years.

**Sandra:** But BOR is equally active in off-years. I'd say BOR success rates don't vary much by reassessment cycle. So the honest advice is: always file at both, but manage expectations — in off-years, BOR is where the real action is.

**Robert:** I'd second that. In my experience, off-year appeals at BOR succeeded at roughly the same rate as reassessment-year appeals. The assessment is what it is; if it's wrong, it's wrong regardless of when the triennial happened.

### Q5: Most common mistakes homeowners make?

**Sandra:** Number one: missing the deadline. By a mile. The township windows are confusing — each township opens at a different time, stays open for about 30 days. People assume "Cook County" has one deadline. They Google "Cook County property tax appeal deadline," find a date that applies to a different township, and miss their window.

**David:** From inside the office, the biggest mistake was bad comp selection. People would submit comps that were completely different properties — a 1,200 sq ft ranch compared to a 2,500 sq ft two-story. Or comps from a different neighborhood entirely. The system can filter some of that, but mostly bad comps just result in a denial.

**Robert:** At BOR, the biggest mistakes: (1) Not showing up for hearings or not submitting written evidence when they could. (2) Making emotional arguments — "my taxes are too high" — instead of data arguments. (3) Confusing assessed value with market value. In Cook County, assessed value is 10% of market value for residential. People see their home is "worth" $300K on Zillow and their assessed value is $30K and think there's no issue. You need to argue the assessed value, not the tax bill.

**Maria:** I'd add: people don't understand the 10% assessment level. They compare their assessed value to sale prices without converting. And they don't understand equalization factors. A $49 product should handle this math for them — never make the customer do assessment-level conversions.

**Sandra:** Also: filing at BOR and thinking you need a lawyer. You don't. The process is designed for pro se homeowners. But people either (a) don't file because they think they need professional help, or (b) hire a firm that takes 30–50% of savings when they could've done it themselves with good data.

### Q6: Uniformity vs overvaluation — which is stronger at each level?

**David:** At the Assessor level, uniformity was king. Our models were assessment-based. If you showed your assessment was out of line with similar properties' *assessments*, that's what triggered adjustments. Market value / overvaluation was secondary.

**Robert:** At BOR, both work, but I'd lean uniformity for Cook County specifically. The county's assessment practices have been criticized for years for lack of uniformity — wealthy areas under-assessed, working-class areas over-assessed. Commissioners are sensitive to this. A strong uniformity argument basically says "you're treating me unfairly compared to my neighbors," and that resonates.

**Maria:** I tell clients: lead with uniformity, support with market value. If you can show BOTH that your assessment is higher than comparable assessments AND that your assessed value exceeds 10% of fair market value, that's the strongest case. But if you have to pick one, pick uniformity.

**Sandra:** Our win data backs this up. Uniformity-primary arguments win at roughly 55% at BOR. Market-value-only arguments win at maybe 40%. Combined arguments: 60%+. For the product, you should generate both analyses but present uniformity first.

### Q7: What does the Assessor portal look like? What fields matter?

**David:** The portal (assessorappeal.cookcountyil.gov) is surprisingly simple for residential. You enter your PIN, it pulls your property details. Then you select your argument type — typically "comparable properties" for sales-based or "assessment comparison" for uniformity. You enter up to 5 comparable PINs with sale prices and dates if doing sales comps. There's a free-text field for additional comments, but honestly, we rarely read those for residential.

**Sandra:** The fields that matter: (1) Your PIN. (2) The comparable PINs — choose carefully, max 5. (3) If doing sales comps, the sale prices and dates. (4) Argument type selection. That's basically it. The rest is optional.

**Maria:** One gotcha: the portal times out. If someone spends 20 minutes trying to figure out which comps to use, they might lose their session. A product that pre-selects the comps and says "enter these 5 PINs" is enormously valuable.

**David:** Also, the portal asks for property characteristics corrections — if your square footage, bedroom count, etc. is wrong in their records, you can flag that. People skip this but it matters. If the Assessor has you at 2,000 sq ft and you're really 1,700, correcting that alone could reduce your assessment.

### Q8: How important are comparable property photos?

**Robert:** At BOR hearings, photos can help — especially if you're arguing your property is in worse condition than comps. But for the average appeal? Data wins over photos. I'd say photos are a "nice to have," not essential.

**Sandra:** We include Google Street View screenshots in our BOR packets. It adds a veneer of professionalism. But I've never won a case on photos that I would've lost without them. The numbers do the talking.

**David:** At the Assessor level, photos are nearly irrelevant. We didn't look at them. It's a data-processing operation.

**Maria:** For a $49 product, I'd skip photos. They're hard to automate, add complexity, and don't move the needle. Focus on comp selection and uniformity data.

### Q9: Do reassessment-year properties have a meaningful advantage?

**Maria:** Yes, meaningful. In reassessment years, values change — sometimes dramatically. A property that jumped 30% is a much easier appeal than one that's been sitting at the same value for two years. The Assessor made a fresh determination, and fresh determinations have more errors.

**Sandra:** Our data shows roughly 2x success rate in reassessment years at the Assessor level. BOR is more stable. So the reassessment year primarily supercharges the first bite.

**David:** And in reassessment years, the Assessor's Office is more willing to adjust because they know the new values were generated algorithmically and may have issues. In off-years, there's more institutional inertia — "we already looked at this."

**Robert:** For BOR, reassessment year or not, a good case is a good case. But I'd acknowledge: the largest dollar reductions tend to happen in reassessment years simply because the starting values are more likely to be inflated.

### Q10: What should a $49 product include? What's missing from DIY guides?

**Sandra:** The #1 thing missing from DIY guides: *specific comparable properties for YOUR house*. Every guide says "find comps." Nobody tells you which comps to use. A product that says "here are your 5 best comps, here are their PINs, enter them into the portal" — that's worth $49 easily.

**Robert:** I'd add: a clear explanation of the two-level process with *your* township's timeline. Generic "Cook County appeal" guides don't tell you that Bloom Township opens in April and Worth Township opens in June. That's confusing and leads to missed deadlines.

**David:** The assessment vs. market value conversion, done for them. "Your home's assessed value is $25,000. Based on comparable sales, the fair market value is $230,000, which should be assessed at $23,000. You're over-assessed by $2,000, or 8.7%." Do the math. Show the math. But don't make them do it.

**Maria:** A pre-filled evidence template. Not just "here's what to include" but "here's your actual document with your numbers, ready to submit." That's what firms charge $300+ for. At $49, that's incredible value.

**Sandra:** And the uniformity analysis. Pull 10-20 nearby comparable assessments, calculate the median per-square-foot, show where the subject property falls. That's the core evidence for Cook County. No DIY guide generates this for you.

### Q11: Request a hearing at BOR or just written evidence?

**Robert:** For simple residential appeals — standard single-family home, clear comp data — written evidence is fine. Our written-only approval rate wasn't much different from hearing approval rates. Maybe 5% lower.

**Sandra:** We default to written-only for our clients unless the case is complex or high-value (>$1M assessment). Hearings are phone-based now, 5–10 minutes. They're not scary, but they're not necessary for most cases.

**Maria:** I'd recommend the product advise: submit written evidence. If denied, you can still go to PTAB. A hearing adds a time commitment and anxiety for minimal benefit on straightforward cases.

**Robert:** Agreed. For a $49 DIY product, telling people to submit written evidence is the right call. Less intimidating, nearly as effective, and avoids scheduling complications.

**Sandra:** One exception: if someone's case is marginal — the comps aren't great, the uniformity argument is thin — a hearing lets you make a persuasive case that paper alone might not. But for a mass-market product, written evidence is the right default.

### Q12: LLC/trust-owned properties?

**Sandra:** About 15-20% of residential properties in Cook County are in trusts, and a growing number in LLCs. The appeal process is identical for trusts. For LLCs, there's no meaningful difference in filing either — you file by PIN, not by owner type.

**Maria:** The only wrinkle is the BOR complaint form asks for owner information. If it's an LLC, you list the LLC as owner. Some people panic about this. It's straightforward.

**David:** From the Assessor side, we didn't care about ownership structure. A PIN is a PIN.

**Robert:** Same at BOR. We never treated trust or LLC properties differently. I wouldn't build special handling for this into the product. Maybe a one-line FAQ: "If your property is in a trust or LLC, file the same way — just use the entity name as the property owner."

### Panel 1: Key Consensus Points

1. **Always file at both levels.** Assessor + BOR are additive. Zero downside to Assessor filing.
2. **BOR does NOT see your Assessor-level filing.** The systems are independent.
3. **Same evidence works for both levels** — comps and uniformity analysis. Different *presentation* (Assessor = structured form, BOR = evidence packet).
4. **Uniformity is the strongest argument** in Cook County at both levels. Lead with uniformity, support with market value.
5. **The #1 value-add is pre-selected comps with PINs.** This is what people can't do themselves.
6. **Township-specific deadlines are the #1 confusion point.** Solve this or lose customers.
7. **Written evidence is sufficient at BOR** for standard residential appeals. Don't push hearings.
8. **Reassessment years are significantly better** for Assessor-level appeals. Less difference at BOR.
9. **Photos are not worth the effort** for a $49 product. Data wins.
10. **LLC/trust properties need no special handling.** A FAQ line suffices.

### Panel 1: Disputed Points

1. **Off-year Assessor filing value** — Maria and Sandra agree it's worth doing but success drops to ~15-20%. David agrees. Not a real dispute, but expectations should be managed.
2. **Hearing vs written at BOR** — Mild disagreement on whether to even mention hearings. Robert says written is fine; Sandra notes marginal cases benefit from hearings. Consensus: default to written, mention hearings as optional.

### Panel 1: Actionable Recommendations

**P0 (Must have):**
- Pre-selected comparable properties with PINs, ready to enter into both portals
- Uniformity analysis (assessment per sq ft comparison to nearby properties)
- Township-specific deadline information for the customer's property
- Clear two-level filing strategy explanation
- Step-by-step portal walkthroughs for both Assessor and BOR
- Assessment math done for the customer (assessed value → market value → target value)

**P1 (Should have):**
- Reassessment year vs off-year context (set expectations appropriately)
- Property characteristics check (flag potential square footage / bedroom errors in Assessor records)
- Market value / overvaluation analysis as secondary argument

**P2 (Nice to have):**
- PTAB mention as third option if BOR fails
- FAQ covering trusts/LLCs, equalization factors, common myths
- Hearing tips for those who want to attend BOR hearing

## PANEL 2: Product/UX Design Panel

**Participants:**
- **Jessica Park** — Former TurboTax lead designer (guided tax filing UX)
- **Marcus Rivera** — LegalZoom product lead (complex legal → simple consumer)
- **Anika Sharma** — Stripe documentation lead (technical docs people actually read)
- **Tyler Brooks** — Ownwell product manager (direct competitor, property tax appeals)

---

### Q1: Three documents vs two vs one?

**Jessica:** From a TurboTax perspective — the user doesn't think in "documents." They think in "what do I do?" I'd argue for ONE document that's structured in sections, not three separate PDFs. Three attachments in an email is immediately overwhelming.

**Tyler:** At Ownwell, we don't give users documents at all — we do it for them. But for a DIY product at $49, I actually think two documents is right: one "what to do" guide and one evidence packet. The evidence packet is the *thing* they submit. The guide tells them how to submit it. Separate artifacts with separate purposes.

**Marcus:** I'm with Tyler. At LegalZoom, we learned that combining instructional content with the actual legal document confuses people. They can't figure out what to read vs what to file. Separate the instructions from the deliverable.

**Anika:** Two documents, agreed. But I'd structure it as: (1) a guide that includes everything — strategy, timeline, step-by-step instructions for both portals, and (2) the evidence packet. The "Quick Start Guide" and "Filing Guides" as described should be ONE document, not two. Three is too many.

**Jessica:** Strong agree with Anika. Merge the Quick Start and Filing Guides into one cohesive guide. Users won't read three documents. They'll read one, maybe two.

**Tyler:** So the consensus is two: Guide + Evidence Packet. I think that's right. The guide does the heavy lifting — explains the strategy, gives the timeline, walks through both portals. The evidence packet is the professional-looking document they actually submit.

### Q2: Handling "two filing paths" without overwhelming?

**Jessica:** TurboTax's core insight: show people ONE step at a time. Don't explain both paths upfront. Start with "Step 1: File with the Assessor." Only after that section is covered, introduce "Step 2: File with the Board of Review." Sequential, not parallel.

**Marcus:** Yes — and frame it as a natural sequence, not a choice. "Cook County gives you TWO chances to reduce your assessment. Here's how to use both." Don't make them decide which to do. Tell them to do both.

**Anika:** I'd use a visual timeline early in the guide. Something like:

```
[Assessor Appeal] ──30 days──→ [Wait for result] ──→ [BOR Appeal] ──30 days──→ [Final result]
```

One glance tells the whole story. Then the rest of the guide walks through each phase in order.

**Tyler:** The "two bites at the apple" framing is good. People get that instantly. "You get two chances. The first is quick and easy. The second is more thorough. We'll help you with both."

### Q3: Rolling deadlines — how to communicate without going stale?

**Tyler:** This is the hardest UX problem in Cook County. At Ownwell, we handle this dynamically because we're a web app. For a PDF product, you HAVE to personalize this at generation time.

**Anika:** The PDF must state the specific township and the specific deadline window. "Your property is in **Bloom Township**. The Assessor appeal window typically opens in **April 2026** and closes after approximately 30 days." If you can pull the exact dates, even better.

**Jessica:** Add a caveat: "Dates are based on historical patterns and may shift. Check [assessor website link] to confirm your township's exact dates." This manages the staleness risk while still being 10x more helpful than generic advice.

**Marcus:** I'd also include a QR code or short link to a live page on getovertaxed.com that shows current deadline status. The PDF is a snapshot; the link is a living resource. This also drives traffic back to your site.

**Tyler:** Love the QR code idea. And send a deadline reminder email when you know their township window is approaching. That's a post-purchase touchpoint that adds massive value and costs nothing.

**Anika:** Bold the deadline information. Put it in a colored box. Make it impossible to miss. If someone skims the entire guide and only reads one thing, it should be their deadline.

### Q4: Dynamic vs universal Quick Start Guide?

**Jessica:** Dynamic, 100%. If you're generating a PDF per property anyway, there's no reason to give someone in a reassessment year the same guide as someone in an off-year. The advice differs: "This is your reassessment year — your assessment just changed, and Assessor-level appeals are especially effective right now" vs "This is an off-year — BOR is your strongest opportunity."

**Marcus:** Agreed. But don't create two completely different documents. Use a single template with conditional sections. 80% of the content is identical. The 20% that differs: (1) reassessment context, (2) deadline information, (3) expectations for success at each level.

**Anika:** Template with variables. Township name, reassessment status, deadline estimates, target assessment values — all dynamically inserted. The guide should feel personally written for their property.

**Tyler:** At Ownwell, personalization is our entire value proposition. The more the guide feels like it was written for *their house*, the more it's worth $49. Generic guides are free on the internet. Personalized analysis is worth paying for.

### Q5: "What do I do RIGHT NOW" vs "complete picture"?

**Jessica:** Page 1 should be a one-page action summary. Something like:

> **Your Property: 1234 Main St, Skokie, IL**
> **Township: Niles | Reassessment Year: 2025**
>
> **Right now:** Your Assessor appeal window opens ~March 2026. File using the step-by-step instructions on page 5.
>
> **After that:** Your BOR appeal window opens ~3 months later. Instructions on page 12.
>
> **Your potential savings: $800–$1,500/year** based on comparable properties.

Then the rest of the guide provides the complete picture.

**Marcus:** This is the "executive summary" pattern. Every LegalZoom product has it. Nobody reads front-to-back. They read the summary, then jump to the section they need.

**Anika:** Stripe's documentation uses "Quick Start" → "Full Reference" structure. Same idea. Give them the 30-second version, then the full picture if they want it.

**Tyler:** The potential savings estimate on page 1 is *critical*. That's what keeps them engaged. "Based on our analysis, your property appears over-assessed by $3,200 (8.2%). If corrected, you could save approximately $1,100 per year." Now they're motivated to read the filing instructions.

### Q6: Progressive disclosure — page 1 vs deeper?

**Jessica:** Page 1: Property summary, savings estimate, next action, deadline. Pages 2-3: Two-level strategy overview with timeline. Pages 4-8: Assessor filing walkthrough. Pages 9-14: BOR filing walkthrough. Back pages: FAQ, glossary, PTAB mention.

**Anika:** I'd add a "How to read this guide" callout on page 1. "If your Assessor window is open now → go to page 4. If your BOR window is open now → go to page 9. If neither is open yet → read the strategy overview on page 2."

**Marcus:** Navigation is key in a PDF. Use clear section headers, page numbers in the table of contents, and visual markers (colored sidebar or tab markers) for each section. People will jump around — make that easy.

**Tyler:** Don't bury the comps. The evidence packet is separate, but the guide should reference it: "Your evidence packet (attached separately) contains 5 comparable properties and a uniformity analysis. You'll use these when filing."

### Q7: Mobile-first PDF that works at a computer while filing?

**Jessica:** Single-column layout. No two-column formats that break on phones. Large text (12pt minimum body). Big, tappable links. QR codes for all portal URLs so mobile readers can get to the right page.

**Anika:** For the "filing at the computer" use case: make the guide work as a side-by-side reference. That means instructions should be step-numbered and concise. "Step 3: In the 'Comparable PIN' field, enter: 12-34-567-890" — not a paragraph explaining what PINs are.

**Marcus:** Test the PDF at 50% zoom on a laptop. That's how people will actually view it — half screen for the guide, half screen for the portal. If it's readable at 50%, you're good.

**Tyler:** Screenshot the portal screens and annotate them. "You'll see this screen. Click here. Enter this." Visual step-by-step beats text every time for filing instructions.

**Jessica:** Agreed on screenshots. And make them current-year screenshots. Nothing kills trust faster than a screenshot that looks different from what the user sees. Plan to update these annually.

### Q8: Evidence packet is identical for both levels — make explicit?

**Anika:** Make it explicit. Right on the evidence packet cover page: "This analysis is designed for use at BOTH the Assessor and Board of Review levels. You do not need separate evidence."

**Marcus:** And in the guide, when you get to the BOR section, remind them: "You'll use the same Evidence Packet you received. No additional evidence is typically needed."

**Tyler:** This is actually a selling point, not a confusion risk. "One comprehensive analysis that works for both appeal levels" sounds premium. "Buy once, use twice."

**Jessica:** Frame it as a feature. "Your Evidence Packet includes comparable properties and a uniformity analysis accepted at both appeal levels." People will feel like they're getting more value.

### Q9: Email delivery structure?

**Tyler:** One email, two attachments. People lose emails. If you send two emails, they'll have one and not the other when they sit down to file. Keep it together.

**Jessica:** Agree — one email. But make the email body itself a mini quick-start. Not just "here are your documents." The email should say: "Your property: [address]. Your next filing window: [date]. Open your Guide to get started."

**Anika:** Subject line matters enormously. Not "Your Overtaxed Purchase" — instead: "Your Property Tax Appeal Package for [Address] — Save up to $[X]/year". Make them open it.

**Marcus:** And a follow-up email. 48 hours later: "Have you opened your appeal package? Your filing window opens in X days." Then a deadline reminder when their township window opens. These are free to send and dramatically increase the chance they actually use the product.

**Tyler:** The follow-up sequence is huge. At Ownwell, our biggest problem is customers who pay and then never complete filing. A $49 product has the same risk. The follow-up emails are insurance against "I paid but never used it."

**Jessica:** Keep the PDF filenames clear: `Appeal-Guide-1234-Main-St.pdf` and `Evidence-Packet-1234-Main-St.pdf`. Not `overtaxed-document-1.pdf`.

### Q10: What makes it feel worth $49 vs "I could have Googled this"?

**Tyler:** The data. Period. You can Google "how to appeal property taxes in Cook County" and get decent instructions. You CANNOT Google a personalized uniformity analysis with pre-selected comparable PINs. That's the value.

**Sandra (editorial note: echoing Panel 1):** Agreed — the comps and uniformity analysis are ungoogleable. That's the product.

**Anika:** The *specificity* is the value. Every number, every PIN, every deadline should be specific to their property. The guide should never say "find comparable properties." It should say "use these comparable properties."

**Marcus:** Perceived value = personalization + professionalism + actionability. The PDF should look like something a $300/hour consultant would produce. Clean design, property-specific data, clear next steps. If it looks like a blog post, it feels free. If it looks like a professional report, it feels worth $49.

**Jessica:** A one-page "savings estimate" with real numbers is the emotional anchor. "Based on our analysis, your assessment could be reduced by approximately $3,200, saving you an estimated $1,100 annually. Over 3 years before the next reassessment, that's $3,300 — a 67x return on your $49 investment." If they see that math, $49 feels like a no-brainer.

**Tyler:** And the time savings. "This package replaces approximately 4–6 hours of research, data gathering, and form preparation." People value their time. $49 for 5 hours of work saved is $10/hour — and most people earning enough to own property in Cook County value their time way higher.

### Panel 2: Key Consensus Points

1. **Two documents, not three.** Merge Quick Start + Filing Guides into one Guide. Evidence Packet is separate.
2. **Sequential framing** for the two levels. Not a choice — a sequence. "Step 1: Assessor. Step 2: BOR."
3. **Personalize everything.** Township name, deadlines, reassessment status, savings estimate, comp PINs — all dynamic.
4. **Page 1 = action summary** with property info, savings estimate, next step, and deadline.
5. **One email, two attachments.** Follow up with deadline reminders.
6. **The evidence packet IS the product.** The guide is how you use it. Pre-selected comps are the ungoogleable value.
7. **Make the identical evidence packet a feature**, not a confusion point. "Works for both levels."
8. **Professional design** = perceived value. It should look like a $300 consulting report.
9. **Screenshot portal walkthroughs** for filing instructions. Visual > text.
10. **Follow-up email sequence** to drive actual filing behavior.

### Panel 2: Disputed Points

1. **QR codes vs just links** — Minor disagreement on whether QR codes in PDFs add value or clutter. Consensus: include for portal URLs at minimum.
2. **How much to explain the "why"** — Jessica favors minimal explanation, just steps. Marcus and Anika want enough context that people feel educated. Consensus: brief "why this matters" before each section, then pure step-by-step.

### Panel 2: Actionable Recommendations

**P0 (Must have):**
- Two-document structure: Guide + Evidence Packet
- Dynamic personalization (township, deadline, reassessment year, savings estimate)
- Page 1 action summary with specific property info and savings estimate
- Step-by-step portal walkthroughs with screenshots for both Assessor and BOR
- Pre-selected comparable PINs listed explicitly in evidence packet
- One email with both attachments + meaningful email body
- Professional design that looks like a consulting report

**P1 (Should have):**
- Follow-up email sequence (48hr nudge + deadline reminder)
- QR codes for portal URLs

## COMBINED RECOMMENDATIONS: Implementation Plan

### Architecture Decision: Two Documents

| Document | Contents | Personalized? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Appeal Guide** | Strategy overview, two-level explanation, timeline, Assessor filing walkthrough, BOR filing walkthrough, FAQ | Yes — township, deadlines, reassessment status, savings estimate |
| **Evidence Packet** | Property summary, comparable properties (with PINs), uniformity analysis, market value analysis | Yes — all property-specific data |

### P0: Must Ship (Before Launch)

1. **Restructure from 3 docs to 2.** Merge Quick Start + Filing Guides into a single Appeal Guide.

2. **Appeal Guide structure:**
   - Page 1: Action summary (address, township, reassessment status, deadline, savings estimate, "start here" pointer)
   - Pages 2–3: Two-bite strategy overview + visual timeline
   - Pages 4–8: Assessor portal walkthrough (numbered steps, comp PINs to enter, screenshots)
   - Pages 9–14: BOR filing walkthrough (numbered steps, how to attach evidence packet, screenshots)
   - Pages 15–16: FAQ (trusts/LLCs, equalization factors, PTAB, when to request a hearing)

3. **Evidence Packet structure:**
   - Cover page: property info + "For use at Assessor AND Board of Review levels"
   - Uniformity analysis (primary argument): comparable assessments per sq ft
   - Market value analysis (secondary argument): comparable sales
   - Property characteristics: subject property details vs comparable properties
   - Each comp listed with: PIN, address, sq ft, bedrooms, year built, assessed value, sale price if available

4. **Dynamic personalization** in PDF generation:
   - Township name and reassessment year status
   - Estimated filing windows (Assessor + BOR) based on township historical patterns
   - Savings estimate range based on uniformity gap
   - Pre-selected comparable PINs (5 for Assessor form, 10–20 for evidence packet)
   - Assessment math: current assessed value → fair assessed value → annual tax savings

5. **Lead with uniformity at both levels.** Structure evidence with uniformity analysis first, market value second.

6. **Professional PDF design.** Teal + warm beige color scheme (matching getovertaxed.com), clean typography, colored section tabs, proper page numbers.

7. **Email delivery:** One email, two PDF attachments, with email body containing: property address, savings estimate, next deadline, "Open your Appeal Guide to get started."

### P1: Should Ship (Within 2 Weeks of Launch)

8. **Portal screenshots.** Capture and annotate current Assessor and BOR portal screens. Build into the guide template.

9. **Follow-up email sequence:**
   - 48hr: "Have you started your appeal?"
   - Township window opening: "Your Assessor filing window is NOW OPEN. Here's what to do today."
   - Township window closing (7 days before): "Your deadline is in 7 days."
   - BOR window opening: "Time for your second appeal."

10. **Reassessment year conditional content.** Different messaging for reassessment year ("Your assessment just changed — this is the best time to appeal") vs off-year ("Even in an off-year, reductions are possible, especially at BOR").

11. **Live deadline page** on getovertaxed.com showing current township windows. Link from the PDF via QR code.

12. **Property characteristics check.** Flag in the guide if any recorded characteristics (sq ft, bedrooms) appear incorrect based on available data, and instruct the user to correct them on the Assessor portal.

### P2: Iterate Post-Launch

13. **PTAB guidance.** Brief section explaining the third appeal option if BOR denies. Keep it simple — most won't need it.

14. **Hearing preparation tips** for users who want to attend a BOR hearing (optional section).

15. **Annual screenshot refresh process.** Portal UIs change. Plan to update screenshots each appeal season.

16. **A/B test email subject lines** and follow-up sequences for open/action rates.

17. **Customer feedback loop.** Post-filing survey: "Did you file? At which level? Were the instructions clear? What would you improve?"

### Key Insight: The Competitive Moat

The $49 price point occupies a gap no one else fills:
- **Free resources** (CCAO website, DIY blogs): Give general instructions but no personalized data
- **Ownwell/AppealDesk** ($0 upfront, 25-35% of savings): Full service, but take $200-500+ from a typical reduction
- **Tax attorneys** ($300-500+): Personal service, often overkill for straightforward residential appeals

**Overtaxed at $49** delivers the personalized data and analysis that makes DIY actually work, without the percentage-of-savings fee. The evidence packet with pre-selected comps is the ungoogleable core. The guide with portal walkthroughs and deadline management is what makes it usable. Together, they replace 4-6 hours of research and give the homeowner a genuine shot at $500-2,000+/year in savings.

**The two-level strategy is the differentiator.** No other $49 product (that we're aware of) walks someone through both the Assessor AND BOR process. Most DIY guides focus on one or the other. Our approach of "file at both, same evidence, two chances" is simple, correct, and maximizes the customer's odds.
