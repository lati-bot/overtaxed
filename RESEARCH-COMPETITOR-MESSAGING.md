## 1. Ownwell (ownwell.com) — Biggest Name in DIY/Hybrid

**Homepage Headline:** "Reduce Your Property Taxes"

**Service Description:** End-to-end property tax reduction — from paperwork filing to discussions with county assessors and attending appeal board hearings. Uses "proprietary technology and local knowledge." Positions as tech-enabled expert service.

**Pricing Model:** Contingency fee (~25% of savings). No upfront costs. "Savings-or-Free Guarantee." Example given: if bill reduced by $1,000, fee = $250.

**CTA Language:** Address entry field (instant engagement), "savings calculator"

**What They Do Better:** Multi-state coverage, polished tech-forward brand, massive scale, savings calculator as lead gen tool, strong SEO/brand recognition

**What We Could Do Better:** More transparent about actual fee percentage upfront, more personal service, lower fees

## 2. O'Connor & Associates (poconnor.com) — Largest TX Firm

**Homepage Headline:** "Residential Property Tax Reduction Services" / "It's your right to challenge the appraisal district 'guesstimate of value'"

**Service Description:** Full-service protest through all 3 phases: informal hearing, ARB formal hearing, and judicial appeal/binding arbitration. Emphasizes they're the most "aggressive" firm. Uses words: "protest," "reduction," "fight," "guesstimate of value."

**Pricing Model:** 50% contingency fee on current year tax savings. No upfront fees. Includes all levels of appeal. No charge for homestead exemptions.

**Trust Signals:**
- "Saved clients over $213 million in property taxes in 2025"
- "One of the nation's top property tax consulting firms"
- Decades of experience implied
- Client portal for status tracking

**Key Claims:**
- $213M+ saved in 2025
- More aggressive and effective than any other firm in TX
- All 3 phases of appeal covered
- Automatic year-over-year enrollment

**CTA Language:** Sign-up focused, deadline-driven urgency (county deadline tables)

**What They Do Better:** Judicial appeals and binding arbitration capability, massive scale, $213M savings claim, comprehensive 3-phase approach

**What We Could Do Better:** 50% contingency is very high — easy to beat on price. Website is dated and text-heavy. No modern UX.

## 3. SquareDeal Tax (squaredeal.tax) — DIY Platform

**Homepage Headline:** "Property tax protest. Lower your property tax" (site requires JavaScript — limited content extraction)

**Service Description:** DIY-focused platform. Blog positions them as the "do it yourself, do it right" option. Heavy content marketing around educating homeowners. Covers Texas, Illinois, Missouri.

**Pricing Model:** Likely flat-fee or low-cost DIY tools (blog references competitors keeping "50% of your savings" and positions SquareDeal as "a tenth of this or less"). Estimated ~$50-100 flat fee for DIY tools.

**Trust Signals:**
- Extensive educational blog content
- Transparent data and analysis in posts
- Multi-state (TX, IL, MO)

**Key Claims:**
- DIY approach saves more than contingency firms over time
- "No Reduction, No Fee" model criticized as misleading (their blog argues it hides opportunity cost)

**CTA Language:** "Check Your Savings for FREE!"

**What They Do Better:** Educational content strategy is excellent. Positions DIY as empowering. Honest about industry dynamics.

**What We Could Do Better:** They're content-only with weak homepage UX (JS-required, poor extraction). We can offer better onboarding experience.

## 4. Texas Tax Protest (texastaxprotest.com) — Traditional Firm

**Homepage Headline:** "Property Taxes Too High? Winning fair tax assessments for Texas property owners"

**Service Description:** Full-service protest firm. "We collect evidence, manage all paperwork, and advocate on your behalf." Uses proprietary "big data algorithms" and "research technology." Emphasizes "Real People Support — no offshore call centers."

**Pricing Model:** Contingency (percentage not stated on homepage). No upfront fees implied.

- 4 office locations (DFW, Houston, Austin, San Antonio)

**Key Claims:**
- $85M+ in tax savings
- Over 10 years in business
- Texas-based, real people support
- Big data technology

**CTA Language:** "Get Started" (repeated), contact form with property type selector

**What They Do Better:** Strong local presence (4 TX offices), human support angle, solid review count, case studies

**What We Could Do Better:** Their $85M claim is dwarfed by O'Connor's $213M. We can position with more specific per-customer metrics rather than aggregate.

## 5. Home Tax Shield (hometaxshield.com) — Newer Entrant

**Homepage Headline:** "Helping Texans Pay Fair Property Taxes"

**Service Description:** "Texas-based property tax platform that brings technology, experience and a personal commitment to the valuation and protest process." Notable honesty: "Protesting delivers a 3-5% reduction on average." Warns against too-good-to-be-true promises.

**Pricing Model:** Not clearly stated on homepage. Likely contingency or flat-fee. Differentiates from "no upfront fees" competitors.

**Trust Signals:**
- Honest/realistic expectations messaging
- "What sets Home Tax Shield apart?" positioning
- Texas-based

**Key Claims:**
- 3-5% average reduction (refreshingly honest)
- "If it sounds too good to be true, it is" — contrarian positioning against over-promising competitors

**CTA Language:** "Get Started," "Sign In"

**What They Do Better:** Honest, realistic expectation-setting. Anti-hype positioning could build trust with skeptical homeowners.

**What We Could Do Better:** Their site had limited content extraction. We can be both honest AND compelling.

## 6. Gill Denson & Company (gilldenson.com) — Boutique Firm

**Homepage Headline:** "Property Tax Reduction Service — More than 80% of Our Clients Received a Tax Appraisal Reduction Last Year!"

**Service Description:** Boutique firm emphasizing "custom tailored approach" vs. mass appeal. "We get to know every property like it is our own." Serves residential, commercial, and BPP across all 254 TX counties.

## 7. CheckMyPropertyTax (checkmypropertytax.com) — New Flat-Fee Competitor

**Homepage Headline:** "See If Your Texas Property Appraisal Is Too High"

**Service Description:** Very minimal site — appears to be early-stage. Lead generation via address check.

**Pricing Model:** Unknown / not visible. Likely flat-fee based on task description context.

**Trust Signals:** Minimal — early stage site.

**Key Claims:** None visible.

**CTA Language:** Implied address lookup tool.

**What They Do Better:** Clean, simple entry point.

**What We Could Do Better:** They appear very early stage — we have more substance to offer.

## 8. AppealDesk (appealdesk.com) — $49 Competitor

**Homepage Headline:** "Stop Overpaying Your Property Taxes" / "Property Tax Appeal Evidence Packet — $49"

**Service Description:** DIY evidence packet service. Provides comparable sales analysis, filing guide, and cover letter — delivered in minutes. You file yourself. "All 50 states." Founded by Rob Hartley, financial analyst.

**Pricing Model:** **$49 flat fee, one-time.** Keep 100% of savings. No percentage. Ever. Directly attacks Ownwell's 25-35% model.

**Trust Signals:**
- "27,782+ homeowners"
- 98.68% win rate (from Hays County data)
- $2,061 avg annual savings (Harris County data)
- "315 viewing now" (social proof / urgency)
- Founder story with personal credibility
- Sourced statistics from IAAO, NTUF, county reports

**Key Claims:**
- 89% of homeowners who protested won a reduction
- 98.68% win rate (Hays County)
- $2,061 avg annual savings
- 126× return on $49 over 3 years
- 30-60% of properties are overassessed nationally
- Fewer than 5% ever file an appeal

**CTA Language:** "Check My Property →", "This is the year you stop overpaying"

**Objection Handling (brilliant):**
- "What if my taxes go UP?" → They can't
- "Will I have to go to a hearing?" → 97% resolved by mail
- "Is this actually worth $49?" → Consultants charge $300-500, Ownwell takes 25-35%

**Comparison Table:** DIY (free but 10-20 hrs) vs AppealDesk ($49, minutes) vs Ownwell (25-35% of savings)

**What They Do Better:** Incredible landing page. Best copywriting in the market by far. Clear value prop, aggressive price anchoring, smart objection handling, sourced claims. $49 flat fee is compelling.

**What We Could Do Better:** They only provide evidence packets — no representation. If we offer actual representation at a competitive price, we beat them on service depth.

## Compiled Analysis

### Common Messaging Patterns Across All Competitors

1. **"You're overpaying"** — Universal opener. Everyone frames it as the homeowner being overcharged.
2. **"No risk / no upfront cost"** — Contingency firms lead with this. Flat-fee firms counter by showing contingency costs more long-term.
3. **"We do the work for you"** — Convenience is the #1 selling point for full-service firms.
4. **"Technology + expertise"** — Nearly everyone claims proprietary tech/data/algorithms.
5. **"Year-over-year automatic"** — Lock-in positioning as a feature, not a trap.
6. **"X million saved"** — Aggregate savings numbers as proof of scale.
7. **Address entry as first CTA** — Low-friction entry point across most modern competitors.

### Gaps in Their Messaging (Things Nobody Talks About That We Could Own)

1. **⏱️ Time-to-value transparency** — Nobody clearly says "here's exactly when you'll see savings on your tax bill." The timeline from signup → protest → result → actual tax bill reduction is murky.

2. **📊 Per-property expected value** — Everyone gives averages. Nobody gives personalized "your property is likely over-assessed by X based on Y" before signup (except AppealDesk partially).

3. **🔍 What actually happens at hearings** — The process is a black box. Nobody demystifies what their team actually does/says at ARB hearings. Video content opportunity.

4. **💰 True cost comparison** — Only AppealDesk directly compares pricing models. Nobody else shows "here's what you'd pay us vs. doing it yourself vs. other firms."

5. **📈 Compound effect education** — AppealDesk touches this but nobody deeply explains how a reduction this year lowers your baseline for years to come.

6. **🏠 New homeowner onboarding** — Nobody specifically targets first-time homebuyers who don't even know protests exist. Huge audience.

7. **🤝 Post-protest support** — What happens after? Nobody talks about helping you understand your new assessment, monitor for future increases, or plan ahead.

8. **⚖️ Equity/uniformity arguments** — Only SquareDeal's blog covers this. Most competitors focus only on market value protests, ignoring the equity/uniformity angle that can be equally powerful.

9. **🏘️ Neighborhood-level intelligence** — "See how your neighbors' assessments compare" — nobody offers this social/community angle.

10. **😤 Emotional validation** — Nobody acknowledges the frustration and feeling of helplessness. Home Tax Shield comes closest but doesn't lean in.

```

**Quadrant Summary:**
- **Premium Full-Service:** O'Connor, Gill Denson, Texas Tax Protest — high contingency, do everything
- **Tech-Enabled Full-Service:** Ownwell — lower contingency, modern UX, scale play
- **Honest Moderate:** Home Tax Shield — realistic expectations, moderate pricing
- **Budget DIY:** AppealDesk, SquareDeal — flat fee, you file yourself

### Strategic Implications for Overtaxed

**Biggest opportunity:** There's a clear gap between AppealDesk ($49 DIY packet) and Ownwell (25% contingency full-service). A service that offers **real representation at a flat fee or low contingency** (e.g., 10-15% or $149-299 flat) could own the "best of both worlds" position.

**Messaging angles to own:**
1. **Radical transparency** — show the math, show the process, show what others charge
2. **New homeowner focus** — untapped audience nobody targets
3. **Neighborhood intelligence** — "see how your street compares"
4. **True cost of inaction** — compound loss calculator
5. **Human + tech at fair price** — not a $49 packet, not a 50% haircut
