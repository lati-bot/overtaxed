## 1. Condition Issues That Reduce Value

### Foundation Issues
- **Value impact:** 10–25% reduction in market value
- **Typical repair cost (Texas):** $3,300–$15,000 (moderate); up to $25,000+ for severe
- **Signs:** Cracks in walls/floors, uneven flooring, doors that stick, settling
- **Why it matters at ARB:** Foundation is THE #1 structural concern. A $300,000 home with foundation issues can lose $30,000–$75,000 in value instantly
- **Texas-specific:** Texas expansive clay soil makes foundation problems extremely common. ARB panels are very familiar with this issue
- **Pier work:** Steel piers average $1,200–$1,500 per pier; most homes need 8–15 piers ($10,000–$22,500)

### Roof Damage / Age
- **Value impact:** 5–15% reduction depending on severity
- **Typical repair cost:** $500–$3,000 (repair); $7,000–$15,000+ (full replacement, Texas)
- **Signs:** Missing/damaged shingles, leaks, visible wear, age >15 years for composition
- **Why it matters:** Old or damaged roof signals deferred maintenance AND potential hidden water damage
- **Expected lifespan:** Composition shingles 15–25 years; tile 40–50 years
- **Hail damage:** Very common in Texas; can require full replacement even on newer roofs

### HVAC System
- **Value impact:** $5,000–$10,000 reduction for failing/outdated system
- **Typical replacement cost:** $5,000–$10,000 (full system, Texas)
- **Age threshold:** Appraisers flag systems >13 years old; "old" at 10+ years
- **Why it matters:** In Texas, a working A/C is not optional — it's essential. Buyers deduct full replacement cost
- **ROI insight:** Homeowners recoup only 40–60% of HVAC investment in added value — meaning a failing system costs MORE than replacement price in lost value

### Plumbing Issues
- **Value impact:** 5–10% for major issues; cost-of-repair for minor
- **Typical repair cost:** $150 (minor); $3,000–$5,000+ (major); $4,000–$15,000 (full re-pipe)
- **Red flags:** Galvanized pipes (pre-1970s homes), sewer line issues, visible leaks, low water pressure
- **Why it matters:** Galvanized pipe replacement is expensive and signals a home's age/condition
- **Sewer line:** Camera inspection + replacement: $3,000–$8,000

### Electrical System
- **Value impact:** Cost-of-repair reduction, plus safety stigma
- **Typical repair cost:** $100–$300 (small fixes); $3,000–$8,000 (full rewiring)
- **Red flags:** Outdated panel (<100 amp), aluminum wiring, knob-and-tube, Federal Pacific panels
- **Why it matters:** Safety hazard = significant buyer deterrent. Insurance may refuse coverage
- **Panel upgrade alone:** $1,500–$3,000

### Water Damage / Mold
- **Value impact:** 3–15%+ depending on severity and remediation status
- **Typical repair cost:** $1,400–$6,400 (water damage restoration); $1,200–$9,500 (mold remediation)
- **Why it matters at ARB:** Water damage = evidence of ongoing/past problems. Mold carries health stigma
- **Key stat:** NAR study shows homes with water damage history sell for average 3% less even after repair
- **Unremediated mold:** Can reduce value 10–20%+ due to health concerns and remediation cost

### Termite Damage
- **Value impact:** 10–20% reduction
- **Typical repair cost:** $500–$2,000 (minor); up to $25,000+ (major structural)
- **Average treatment:** $300–$800 annually for prevention
- **Why it matters:** Termites are common in Texas. Active infestation = immediate red flag
- **Key stat:** Average homeowner spends approximately $3,000 on termite damage repairs

### Outdated Kitchen / Bathrooms (Functional Obsolescence)
- **Value impact:** $5,000–$25,000+ depending on market expectations
- **Typical renovation cost:** $15,000–$40,000 (kitchen); $8,000–$20,000 (bathroom)
- **What counts:** Original 1970s/80s fixtures, laminate counters, old appliances, no granite/quartz, single vanity in master
- **Why it matters at ARB:** This is "functional obsolescence" — the property doesn't meet current market expectations

### Fence / Exterior Damage
- **Value impact:** $2,000–$8,000
- **Typical repair cost:** $1,500–$4,000 (fence replacement); varies for siding/exterior
- **What counts:** Leaning/fallen fence, rotting wood, peeling paint, damaged siding, broken gutters
- **Why it matters:** Visual curb appeal issues are easy to photograph and immediately convincing

### Pool in Poor Condition
- **Value impact:** Can REDUCE value by $5,000–$15,000+
- **Cost to repair/resurface:** $10,000–$15,000+; removal costs $10,000–$15,000
- **Why it matters:** A poorly maintained pool is a LIABILITY, not an asset
- **Key insight from Reddit:** "I view them as a negative $15k value to a house, because that is about what it will cost to rip it out"
- **Insurance/liability:** Increases homeowner insurance; some buyers specifically avoid pool homes

### Flood Zone / Drainage Issues
- **Value impact:** 5–15% or more
- **Costs:** Drainage correction $2,000–$10,000; flood insurance $1,000–$3,000+ annually
- **Why it matters:** Recurring flooding = recurring expense and reduced buyer pool
- **External obsolescence argument:** Flood zone is an external factor reducing value permanently

## 2. CAD Condition Ratings & Depreciation

### How CADs Rate Condition (CDU System)

CADs use **Condition, Desirability, and Utility (CDU)** ratings to modify depreciation. The CDU directly affects the **"Percent Good"** applied to replacement cost.

**Standard CDU Scale (most Texas CADs):**

| Rating | Code | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Excellent | 1 | Superior maintenance, like-new condition |
| Very Good | — | Above-average maintenance, minimal wear |
| Good | 2 | Well-maintained, minor cosmetic wear |
| Average | 3 | Normal wear and tear for age (BENCHMARK) |
| Fair | 4 | Below-average maintenance, visible issues |
| Poor | 5 | Significant deferred maintenance, major issues |
| Very Poor | — | Barely habitable, extensive damage |
| Unsound | 6 | Structurally compromised, uninhabitable |

*Source: HCAD Physical Condition codes and general IAAO standards*

### HCAD Specific Codes (Harris County)
- **Residential:** 1 (Excellent) through 6 (Unsound)
- **Average (3)** = benchmark — shows "normal wear and tear" for its age
- **Key insight:** "A dwelling with a physical condition rating of 3 (average) is a dwelling that shows signs of normal 'wear and tear' and exhibits an ordinary standard of maintenance" — HCAD

### How CDU Affects Value

The CDU rating modifies the depreciation schedule. A property rated "Fair" instead of "Average" will have a LOWER percent good, meaning MORE depreciation is applied.

**Example impact on a $200,000 replacement cost home (20 years old):**

| CDU Rating | Approx. Percent Good | Improvement Value |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Excellent | 85% | $170,000 |
| Good | 75% | $150,000 |
| Average | 65% | $130,000 |
| Fair | 55% | $110,000 |
| Poor | 40% | $80,000 |

*Note: These are illustrative examples. Actual percent good tables vary by CAD and age.*

### Effective Year Built

- CADs also use **Effective Year Built** — the year the home is "comparable to" based on condition
- A 1977 home in excellent, remodeled condition might have effective year of 1994
- A 1990 home with extensive deferred maintenance might have effective year of 1975
- **Strategy:** If your effective year is too recent, argue it should be older → more depreciation → lower value
- This is essentially the same lever as CDU — both control depreciation

### Cost Approach Formula (HCAD)

```
(Replacement Cost New × Percent Good) + Land Value = Market Value

Where Percent Good is driven by:
- Age of property
- CDU/Condition rating
- Effective year built
```

### Dollar Difference Between Condition Grades

On a typical Texas home ($300,000 value, $200,000 in improvements):
- **Moving from "Average" to "Fair":** ~$15,000–$25,000 reduction
- **Moving from "Average" to "Poor":** ~$40,000–$60,000 reduction
- **Moving from "Good" to "Average":** ~$15,000–$20,000 reduction

These are rough estimates — actual amounts depend on the specific CAD's depreciation tables and the home's age.

## 3. Documentation ARBs Accept

### Tier 1: Strongest Evidence (Most Persuasive)

1. **Licensed Contractor Estimates on Company Letterhead**
   - Must include: Company name, license #, contact info, date, scope of work, itemized costs
   - Best if from licensed/insured contractor (TREC registered is ideal)
   - Should clearly state what needs repair/replacement and why
   - "Obtain 1–2 written repair estimates from licensed contractors on official letterhead" — Texas PVP
   - **Weight at hearing:** Very high. Third-party documentation from a professional

2. **Professional Home Inspection Reports**
   - Licensed home inspector (TREC licensed in Texas)
   - Itemizes all deficiencies with severity ratings
   - Cost: $350–$600 for a full inspection
   - **Pro tip:** If you bought recently, your purchase inspection is powerful evidence
   - **Weight at hearing:** Very high. Independent, licensed professional assessment

3. **Independent Appraisal**
   - Licensed appraiser provides detailed market value opinion
   - Cost: $300–$600 residential
   - "Can often be the most devastating evidence that a taxpayer can drop in a hearing" — O'Connor
   - **Weight at hearing:** Highest possible. Directly counters CAD's own methodology

### Tier 2: Strong Supporting Evidence

4. **Photographs** (see Section 4 for detailed guidance)
   - "Your photos will often tell a more compelling story than words ever could" — O'Connor
   - Date-stamped and labeled
   - Interior AND exterior
   - **Weight at hearing:** High, especially combined with estimates

5. **Insurance Claim Documentation**
   - Proves damage occurred and its severity
   - Shows repair costs from insurance adjuster
   - Claim denials can also show damage exists but isn't economically repairable
   - **Weight at hearing:** High. Independent third-party verification

6. **Dated Receipts for Recent Repairs**
   - Shows money already spent fixing problems
   - Proves problems existed as of January 1 valuation date
   - Get receipts that pre-date January 1 if possible (shows condition at valuation date)
   - **Weight at hearing:** Moderate-high

### Tier 3: Helpful Supplementary Evidence

7. **HOA Violation Notices**
   - Shows property has documented issues visible from exterior
   - Helpful for fence, paint, exterior condition arguments
   - **Weight at hearing:** Moderate

8. **Building Code Violation Records**
   - City/county citations for code violations
   - Very strong for proving serious condition issues
   - **Weight at hearing:** Moderate-high

9. **Property Owner Written Statement**
   - Your own detailed description of issues
   - Better than nothing, but weakest form alone
   - **Weight at hearing:** Low standalone, helpful as supporting narrative

### What About Verbal Descriptions?

- Verbal descriptions alone are **weak** at ARB hearings
- ARB panels see hundreds of cases — they want **documented evidence**
- "Focus on hard evidence (comps, photos, estimates) over emotional appeals" — Texas PVP
- Texas A&M Real Estate Research Center: "Make a list, take pictures of anything that, as is, would negatively affect the sale price"
- You CAN describe issues verbally during presentation, but always back with photos/documents

### Key Rules for Evidence Submission

- **Submit 14+ days before hearing** (Texas Tax Code §41.67) — gives CAD time to review
- **Bring 4 copies to hearing** (one for you, one for appraiser, one for each of 3 ARB members)
- **Keep evidence focused** — 3–5 strong items > 15 weak items
- **Organize in a binder/packet** with one-page summary on top

## 4. How to Photograph Condition Issues

### General Photography Rules

1. **Date stamps:** Use phone camera with date/time enabled, or include a newspaper/phone showing date in frame
2. **Label everything:** Add captions identifying location and issue (e.g., "Master bathroom — water stain on ceiling from roof leak, Dec 2025")
3. **Both wide and close-up shots:** Wide shot shows context/location; close-up shows severity
4. **Good lighting:** Use flash or additional lighting for dark areas (attics, crawlspaces, under sinks)
5. **Include reference objects for scale:** Ruler, tape measure, coin, or hand next to cracks/damage
6. **Consistent quality:** Don't use blurry photos — they look unprofessional and unconvincing

### What to Photograph (Priority Order)

#### HIGH PRIORITY — Structural Issues
- [ ] Foundation cracks (exterior AND interior walls)
- [ ] Uneven/cracked floors
- [ ] Doors/windows that don't close properly (show gap)
- [ ] Separation between walls and ceiling/floor
- [ ] Leaning/bowing walls
- [ ] Evidence of water intrusion at foundation

#### HIGH PRIORITY — Major Systems
- [ ] HVAC unit with data plate showing age/model
- [ ] Water heater with data plate showing age
- [ ] Electrical panel (open, showing type/brand)
- [ ] Visible plumbing issues (corrosion, leaks, old pipe type)
- [ ] Roof from ground level (missing shingles, sagging, moss)
- [ ] Roof close-up if safely accessible

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY — Interior Condition
- [ ] Kitchen overall (dated cabinets, appliances, countertops)
- [ ] Bathrooms overall (dated fixtures, tile, vanity)
- [ ] Water stains on ceilings/walls
- [ ] Worn/damaged flooring
- [ ] Damaged or peeling paint/wallpaper
- [ ] Any mold/mildew visible
- [ ] Outdated fixtures and finishes

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY — Exterior Condition
- [ ] Fence condition (leaning, rotting, missing sections)
- [ ] Driveway condition (cracks, settling, staining)
- [ ] Siding/brick condition (cracks, gaps, damage)
- [ ] Gutters (missing, damaged, pulling away)
- [ ] Landscaping issues (dead trees, drainage problems)
- [ ] Windows condition (fogged double-pane, rotting frames)

#### SITUATIONAL
- [ ] Pool condition (green water, cracked decking, broken equipment)
- [ ] Garage door condition
- [ ] Deck/patio condition
- [ ] Attic insulation/ventilation issues
- [ ] Crawlspace conditions
- [ ] Evidence of pest damage

### Photo Organization Tips

- **Create a labeled photo sheet** — 4 photos per page with captions
- **Group by system:** Foundation photos together, roof together, etc.
- **Number photos** to reference in your written summary
- **Print color copies** for the hearing (don't rely on screen display)

### Before/After Photos
- If repairs were done AFTER January 1 valuation date: before photos show condition on that date
- If repairs done BEFORE January 1: receipts show money spent, but condition was already addressed
- Before photos are powerful — they show the ARB exactly what existed

## 5. What Condition Arguments WIN

### From Reddit & Forum Success Stories

**Foundation + Photos + Estimates = Strongest combo:**
> "We submit photos of any old messed up part of the house and include recent bids from contractors to fix up anything from foundation to driveway, out of date anything." — r/texas user (annual protester who gets reductions consistently)

**Photo documentation is critical:**
> "Take lots and lots of photos documenting every possible flaw that might make your property less appealing to potential buyers. If you had an inspection done before your purchase, be sure to make a big deal..." — r/RoundRock user

**Comps + condition = powerful combination:**
> "You need to have someone actually good at running comps and pictures showing the bad condition of your home." — r/Dallas user

**Photos + estimates together work best:**
> "On top of the photos have estimates to fix whatever your house needs. You can protest yourself with enough evidence." — r/houston user

### What Types of Conditions Had Biggest Impact?

Based on research across multiple sources:

1. **Foundation issues** — #1 most impactful. ARBs understand the cost and significance
2. **Roof needing replacement** — Visual, expensive, clearly measurable
3. **Major system failures** (HVAC, plumbing) — Essential systems with clear replacement costs
4. **Water damage/mold** — Health concern adds urgency beyond just repair cost
5. **Multiple smaller issues combined** — Individual minor issues may not move the needle, but 10+ photos showing accumulated deferred maintenance tells a story

### Real-World Success Example (from Texas PVP)

> "John's $480,000 home was assessed using the sales comparison approach. The district used comps from a pricier neighborhood, ignoring John's outdated kitchen ($20,000 renovation needed). John filed a protest gathering three comps at $430,000–$440,000, photos of his kitchen, and a $20,000 contractor estimate. At the ARB hearing, he presented a 6-minute case, proposing $435,000. The ARB lowered his assessment to $440,000, saving $1,000 yearly."

### What Doesn't Work Well

- Photos alone without context or estimates
- Complaining about tax rates (ARB only handles VALUE)
- Emotional arguments without data
- Old/undated photos
- Minor cosmetic issues without cost quantification
- Saying "my neighbor's house is nicer" without documented evidence

### Key Stat
"Texas Tax Protest's big data analytics show that detailed cases win 80% of hearings" — Texas PVP

## 6. Functional Obsolescence vs Physical Deterioration

### Physical Deterioration (Condition Issues)

**What it is:** Actual physical damage, wear, and decay of the property

**Examples:**
- Foundation cracks and settling
- Roof leaks, damaged shingles
- Failing HVAC, plumbing, electrical
- Water damage, mold, termites
- Rotting wood, peeling paint
- Worn flooring, broken fixtures

**How to argue at ARB:**
- Show photos of physical damage
- Provide repair estimates with costs
- Compare your property's condition to comps in better shape
- Argue: "A buyer would pay LESS for my home because of these repair needs"
- Quantify: Total repair costs = proposed reduction from assessed value

**Curable vs Incurable:**
- **Curable:** Can be economically fixed (roof replacement, HVAC replacement)
- **Incurable:** Fix costs more than value gained (some foundation issues, structural defects)
- Incurable deterioration has MORE impact on value because the problem is permanent

### Functional Obsolescence (Design/Layout Issues)

**What it is:** Loss of value due to design features that don't meet current market expectations

**Examples:**
- No garage in an area where all homes have garages
- Only 1 bathroom in a 3+ bedroom home
- Outdated kitchen layout (no island, small, closed off)
- Small bedrooms that don't fit modern furniture
- No master bath or walk-in closet
- Single-story in area of two-stories (or vice versa)
- Outdated finishes throughout (popcorn ceilings, original 1970s everything)
- Poor floor plan flow (bedrooms off living room, no hallway)
- Superadequacy: over-improved features that don't add proportional value

**How to argue at ARB:**
- Compare your home's features to comparable sales and competing listings
- Show that homes with modern layouts sell for MORE than yours
- Point out specific deficiencies vs. neighborhood norms
- Argue: "Buyers in this market expect [feature], and my home lacks it"
- Use appraisal terminology: "functional obsolescence" carries weight

**Key concept — Curable vs Incurable Functional Obsolescence:**
- **Curable:** Kitchen/bath update, add a closet, update fixtures — cost to cure < value added
- **Incurable:** Can't add a garage, can't change room sizes without major reconstruction, can't fix poor floor plan — cost to cure > value added
- Incurable functional obsolescence is the STRONGEST argument because it permanently limits value

### Which Has More Impact on ARB Decisions?

**Physical deterioration** is generally easier to prove and quantify:
- Repair estimates provide exact dollar amounts
- Photos clearly show the problem
- ARB members can relate to physical damage

**Functional obsolescence** can have LARGER impact but is harder to prove:
- Requires comparative analysis showing market expectations
- Harder to assign specific dollar amounts
- Works best when combined with comp evidence showing price differential

**Best strategy:** Present BOTH if applicable. Physical issues get attention; functional obsolescence justifies deeper reductions.

---

## 7. External Obsolescence

### What It Is

Loss of value due to factors OUTSIDE the property that the owner cannot control. This is often the most overlooked category in tax protests.

### Common External Obsolescence Factors

| Factor | Typical Impact | How to Document |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Highway/road noise | 5–10% | Decibel readings, photos, traffic data |
| Airport flight path | 5–15% | FAA flight maps, noise contour maps |
| Railroad proximity | 3–8% | Photos, distance measurement, train schedule |
| Power lines/towers | 3–10% | Photos showing proximity, utility maps |
| Cell towers | 2–5% | Photos, tower location databases |
| Commercial development next door | 5–15% | Photos, zoning maps, before/after |
| Environmental contamination | 10–30%+ | EPA records, state environmental reports |
| Flood zone designation | 5–15%+ | FEMA flood maps, insurance requirements |
| Landfill/waste facility nearby | 10–20% | Permit records, distance measurement |
| Neighborhood blight | 5–15% | Photos of surrounding area, crime stats |
| School district changes | 3–10% | Rating changes, enrollment data |
| Major construction nearby | 3–10% | Photos, timeline of project |

### How to Argue External Obsolescence at ARB

1. **Identify the external factor** clearly
2. **Document its proximity** to your property (distance, photos, maps)
3. **Show comparable sales evidence** — find similar homes NOT affected by the factor and compare
4. **Quantify the impact** — difference between affected and unaffected comparable properties
5. **Use appraisal terminology:** "External/economic obsolescence" is a recognized concept

### Key Insight from Texas A&M
> "Consider any 'external obsolescence,' or things that negatively affect value that are out of your control, such as changing traffic patterns or roads that affect access or safe ingress/egress, or an oversupply of similar properties in the market (usually resulting in lower rents and value). External obsolescence could also be something like unattractive neighboring properties or neighborhood blight." — TRERC

### Texas-Specific External Factors
- Hurricane/storm damage to area (not just your home)
- Nearby chemical plant incidents
- Highway expansion taking neighboring properties
- New commercial development changing neighborhood character
- Flooding history of the area (even if your home wasn't flooded)
- Oil/gas well proximity

## 8. Realistic Reduction Amounts

### What Percentage Can Condition Evidence Reduce Value?

| Scenario | Typical Reduction | Likelihood of Success |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Minor cosmetic issues only | 0–3% | Low |
| Moderate deferred maintenance | 3–8% | Medium |
| Major system needing replacement | 5–10% | Medium-High |
| Foundation issues documented | 10–15% | High |
| Multiple major issues combined | 10–20% | High |
| Severe structural + functional | 15–25%+ | High (with strong evidence) |

### Can Condition Evidence Reduce Value BELOW Comp Median?

**Yes, absolutely.** If your property is in WORSE condition than comparable sales, your value should be LOWER than those comps. This is the whole point of condition adjustments.

**How to argue it:**
- "Comp A sold for $350,000 in average condition. My home needs $25,000 in foundation repairs and $10,000 in HVAC replacement. Therefore, my home's value should be $315,000 ($350,000 - $35,000 in needed repairs)."

### Does It Work Better Combined with Comp Evidence or Standalone?

**Combined is ALWAYS stronger.** The ideal protest package:

1. **Comparable sales** showing market value
2. **Condition evidence** showing your property is worth LESS than those comps
3. **Unequal appraisal** showing neighbors are assessed lower

"A $15,000 foundation repair estimate, with photos, supports reducing your $420,000 assessment to $405,000 if comps are in better condition." — Texas PVP

### Realistic Expectations by Home Value

| Home Value | 5% Reduction | 10% Reduction | 15% Reduction |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| $200,000 | $10,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |
| $300,000 | $15,000 | $30,000 | $45,000 |
| $400,000 | $20,000 | $40,000 | $60,000 |
| $500,000 | $25,000 | $50,000 | $75,000 |

**At a 2.5% tax rate:**
- $30,000 reduction = $750/year savings
- $50,000 reduction = $1,250/year savings
- $75,000 reduction = $1,875/year savings

## 9. Getting Contractor Estimates

### Free/Cheap Estimates for Protest Purposes

Most contractors provide **free estimates** as part of their sales process. Here's how to leverage this:

**Foundation Companies:**
- Most Texas foundation repair companies offer FREE inspections and estimates
- They want the business, so they'll come out and document everything
- Companies like Olshan, Perma-Pier, Advanced Foundation Repair routinely provide detailed written estimates
- Ask for the estimate "on company letterhead with license number"

**Roofing Companies:**
- Free inspections are standard — they're hoping for the repair job
- After any hail storm, roofing companies are especially eager
- Get estimate in writing with itemized costs

**HVAC Companies:**
- Many offer free "comfort assessments" or diagnostic visits
- Some charge $75–$150 for a diagnostic but provide written report
- Ask specifically: "Can you document the age and remaining lifespan of my system?"

**Plumbing:**
- Free estimates for visible issues
- Camera inspection of sewer line: $100–$300 (produces compelling video evidence)
- Plumber can document pipe type (galvanized, PVC, copper) and condition

**General Contractors:**
- Can provide comprehensive estimates covering multiple issues
- May charge $100–$200 for a full assessment, but the written report covers everything

### What Should the Estimate Include?

For maximum ARB impact, the estimate should have:

1. ✅ **Company letterhead** with logo, address, phone
2. ✅ **Contractor license number** (Texas requires licensing)
3. ✅ **Date of inspection**
4. ✅ **Property address**
5. ✅ **Detailed description** of each issue found
6. ✅ **Itemized cost breakdown** (labor + materials)
7. ✅ **Total estimated repair cost**
8. ✅ **Contractor's signature**
9. ✅ **Statement of urgency** (if applicable — e.g., "failure to repair may result in further structural damage")

### Do Contractors Know About Tax Protests?

**Many do, especially in Texas.** Foundation companies in particular are familiar with providing estimates for protest purposes. Some tips:

- Be upfront: "I'm gathering documentation for a property tax protest. I need a detailed written estimate of repair costs."
- Most contractors are happy to help — it costs them nothing and may lead to future business
- Some protest companies (like O'Connor) have relationships with contractors who routinely provide estimates

### Online Estimation Tools vs In-Person

| Method | Pros | Cons | ARB Weight |
|--------|------|------|-----------|
| In-person contractor | Most accurate, on letterhead | Takes time to schedule | Highest |
| Online cost calculators | Quick, free | Generic, not property-specific | Very low |
| HomeAdvisor/Angi estimates | Good for ballpark | Not specific to your property | Low |
| Your own estimate | Free, immediate | Self-serving, no credentials | Lowest |

**Bottom line:** In-person contractor estimates are worth the effort. They're free, carry the most weight, and take 30–60 minutes of your time.

### Can Homeowners Estimate Themselves?

- You CAN submit your own estimate, but it carries minimal weight
- ARB members know homeowner estimates are self-serving
- Better approach: Use online tools to estimate, then validate with one contractor visit
- If you absolutely can't get a contractor: provide detailed photos + reference industry average costs with sources
- One Reddit user noted success with: "Just add pictures and your estimate of what it would take to fix"

## 10. Condition Checklist for Homeowners

### Before You Start

- [ ] Look up your property on the CAD website
- [ ] Check your CDU/condition rating
- [ ] Check your effective year built
- [ ] Note any features listed that don't match reality
- [ ] Download/print your property card for reference

### Exterior Inspection Checklist

**Foundation**
- [ ] Walk full perimeter — look for cracks
- [ ] Check for gaps between foundation and siding
- [ ] Look for evidence of previous repairs (pier caps, patches)
- [ ] Check grade/slope around foundation (drainage)
- [ ] Note any areas of settling or heaving
- [ ] 📸 Photo each crack with ruler for scale

**Roof**
- [ ] View from street — look for missing/damaged shingles
- [ ] Check for sagging or uneven roofline
- [ ] Look for moss, algae, or debris buildup
- [ ] Check flashing around chimney, vents, skylights
- [ ] Note age of roof (check permit records or insurance)

### What's "Material" Enough to Present?

**Present it if:**
- Repair cost is >$500
- It would make a buyer negotiate a lower price
- It would show up on a home inspection report
- It's a safety issue
- It affects a major system (roof, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, foundation)
- It's visible and photographs well
- Multiple minor issues combine to tell a "deferred maintenance" story

**Skip it if:**
- It's purely cosmetic AND cheap to fix (<$200)
- It would take more time to explain than it's worth
- It would look trivial compared to your other evidence
- It weakens your credibility (presenting a squeaky door alongside foundation cracks)

### Quick-Hit Issues People Commonly Overlook

1. **Galvanized plumbing** — Very common in pre-1970 Texas homes; replacement costs $4,000–$15,000
2. **Federal Pacific or Zinsco electrical panels** — Known fire hazards; replacement $1,500–$3,000
3. **Single-pane windows** — Energy efficiency and noise issues
4. **Original 1970s/80s bathrooms** — Functional obsolescence even if "working"
5. **No GFCI outlets in wet areas** — Code compliance issue
6. **Poly-B (polybutylene) plumbing** — Known failure risk; replacement needed
7. **Effective year discrepancy** — CAD shows home as more recent than its actual condition warrants
8. **Pool equipment age** — Pumps/heaters last 8–12 years; replacement $1,500–$4,000
9. **HVAC ductwork** — Leaking, uninsulated, or damaged ductwork in attic
10. **Drainage/grading** — Property that holds water after rain
