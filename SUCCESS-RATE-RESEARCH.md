## 5. Cook County, IL

### Board of Review (BOR) Statistics

- **61.6% of all BOR appeals were successful** (2015 Annual Report, most recent widely cited)
- **319,500 appeals filed** in 2015; 86% filed online
- **80% win rate** for residential appeals in 2015 (Chicago Tribune/U of C study)
- **370,000 residential parcels appealed in 2015** — winning reductions 80% of the time
- Total tax savings from appeals: **$224 million in 2015** (estimated by Tribune)
- **Professional firms claim 77-90% success rates** at BOR (Kensington Research: 90%, general BOR rate: ~62%)

### Cook County Assessor (CCAO) Appeals
- **2021 success rate:** 37% with lawyers, 38% without (Axios Chicago)
- **2016 success rate (residential):** 53.9% with attorney, 55.3% without (Chicago Tribune)
- **Key finding: Lawyers DON'T improve success rates at CCAO level** — pro se filers do equally well or better

### BOR Professional vs DIY
- Overall BOR success rate: ~62%
- Professional firms (e.g., Kensington): claim 77-90% success
- **Average reduction achieved by professional firms: $1,000-$5,000/year** (Kensington)

### Critical Cook County Context
- Chicago Tribune / U of C study found appeals **make the system LESS fair** — wealthier neighborhoods appeal more, get reductions, shift burden to poorer neighborhoods
- Appeals tripled between 2003 and 2015
- Attorney fees from residential appeals: **$35 million in 2015** (triple from 2003)
- New York City (larger tax base) had only 53,000 reduction applications vs Cook County's 166,000
- Cook County has open data portal with full BOR appeal decision history

### Combined Success Path (CCAO + BOR)
- Homeowners can appeal FIRST at CCAO, THEN at BOR
- Combined, homeowners who pursue both levels likely have >70% chance of getting some reduction
- After BOR, can appeal to PTAB (Property Tax Appeal Board) or Circuit Court

## 6. DIY vs Agent Success Rates

### ⭐ THE HEADLINE: DIY consistently outperforms agents in Harris County

**Harris County SF Homes — DIY vs Agent Success Rates (SquareDeal.tax / HCAD data):**

| Year | DIY Success Rate | Agent Success Rate | DIY Median Reduction | Agent Median Reduction |
|------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 2017 | **79%** | 66% | $15,000 | $12,944 |
| 2018 | **68%** | 43% | $15,340 | $11,782 |
| 2019 | **83%** | 76% | $16,387 | $12,599 |
| 2020 | **88%** | 74% | $16,568 | $14,085 |
| 2021 | **88%** | 78% | $17,512 | $14,197 |
| 2022 | **81%** | 61% | $21,858 | $18,692 |
| 2023 | 22% | **56%** | $25,010 | $17,862 |
| 2024 | 23% | **27%** | $21,733 | $13,060 |
| 2025 | **71%** | 16% | $20,640 | $13,202 |

### Key Findings:
1. **DIY homeowners have higher success rates than agents in 7 of 9 years** (2017-2025)
2. **DIY median reductions are ALWAYS higher** — by $2,000-$8,000+ per protest
3. The 2023-2024 anomaly (agents winning more) was due to a structural market shift
4. 2025 saw DIY rebound to 71% while agents crashed to 16%
5. **When agents succeed, they get smaller reductions** than DIY homeowners

### Why DIY Outperforms Agents:
- Agents use volume/formula approaches ("5% off for the subdivision")
- DIY homeowners present property-specific evidence
- Agents accept standardized Topline settlements to process quickly
- DIY homeowners are more likely to push for larger reductions
- **Even if agents win, contingency fees (30-50% of savings) eat into the benefit**

### Cook County DIY vs Attorney:
- CCAO 2021: **37% with lawyers, 38% without** — no difference
- BOR 2016: **53.9% with attorney, 55.3% without** — DIY slightly better
- **This is significant for Overtaxed:** We can say evidence-based DIY IS the winning strategy

## 7. Success by Method/Stage

### Texas — Method Breakdown

**Informal Hearing (including iSettle/online):**
- **80-90% success rate statewide** for homeowners
- **85-95% in Harris County** for homeowners
- **70-90% in Dallas County**
- **65-90% in Tarrant County**
- Fastest resolution, lowest stress
- Most homeowners resolve at this stage

**ARB (Appraisal Review Board) Hearing:**
- **Harris County:** 77% overall (83% SF, 61% commercial)
- **Dallas County:** 70% overall (71% SF, 67% commercial)
- **Statewide:** 57% overall (61% SF, 49% commercial)
- More effort, but good odds after informal fails

**Topline Agreed Orders (Texas-specific):**
- Formalized bulk settlements between agents and CADs
- Efficient but may leave money on the table
- Travis County: 71.3% of 2025 protests resolved this way
- Agents dominate this channel (160x more reductions than homeowners in Harris 2025)

**Judicial Appeal / Binding Arbitration:**
- Assessment reductions from judicial appeals: $16.4 billion in 2022 (up 645% from 2012!)
- Increasingly valuable but resource-intensive
- Harris County: 38% of total assessment reductions come from judicial appeals

### Harris County DIY Outcomes — Informal vs ARB (SquareDeal.tax)

| Year | Informal Success | ARB Success |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| 2017 | 66% | 34% |
| 2019 | 61% | 39% |
| 2020 | **75%** | 25% |
| 2021 | 60% | 40% |
| 2022 | 51% | 49% |
| 2023 | 24% | **69%** |
| 2024 | 26% | **71%** |
| 2025 | **65%** | 35% |

**Takeaway:** In normal years, informal is the better path. In tight years (2023-2024), ARB became more important as informal offers tightened.

## 8. Average Reduction Amounts

### Texas Residential Protest Reductions

**Median Reduction in Assessed Value (Harris County SF):**
- 2017: $14,102
- 2019: $15,097
- 2021: $16,637
- 2022: $21,208
- 2023: $22,367
- 2024: $18,991
- 2025: $18,084

**Converting to Tax Savings (at ~2.5% avg tax rate):**
- $15,000 reduction → **~$375/year in tax savings**
- $20,000 reduction → **~$500/year in tax savings**
- $25,000 reduction → **~$625/year in tax savings**

**Published Average Savings Figures:**
- Harris County 2022: **$641 average per homeowner protest** (O'Connor)
- Dallas County 2022: **$1,003 average per homeowner protest** (O'Connor)
- Texas statewide 2022: **$1,093 average per protest** (O'Connor)
- Ownwell claims: **$774 average annual savings** (current marketing)
- Ownwell also claims: **$1,147 average savings** (Business Insider)
- Home Tax Shield: **83% success rate, fees 40% lower**
- Dallas protester average: **$1,000+ on annual tax bill** (2024, per Dallas real estate news)
- **$50,000 average recommended protest value → $1,255/year savings** (Dallas Morning News, 2023)

### Reduction Percentage Distribution (Ownwell 3-Year Study)
Average % reduction when protest is won, by county:
- **Tarrant: 10.1%** (highest)
- **Travis: 7.6%**
- **Harris: 7.2%**
- **Bexar: 6.7%**
- **Dallas: 6.6%**
- **Collin: 5.1%**
- **Fort Bend: 4.9%** (lowest)

### Does Reduction Correlate with Property Value?
- Higher-value homes protest more: In Harris County 2024, the 31% who protested owned 42.3% of market value
- Commercial properties get LARGER dollar reductions ($7,065 avg in Harris 2022 vs $641 for residential)
- But residential reductions as % of value are comparable (5-10%)

---

## 9. What Drives Successful Outcomes

### Evidence Quality is #1

**Best evidence types (in order of effectiveness):**

1. **Equity/Unequal Appraisal Comps** — Compare your property's assessed value per square foot to similar nearby properties. If neighbors pay less per sqft, you have a strong case.
   - Texas Tax Code allows protesting on market value "and/or" unequal appraisal
   - **This is the most commonly successful argument in Texas** because TX is a non-disclosure state (no public sales data)
   - 3-5 comparable properties with lower assessed values is the sweet spot

2. **Comparable Sales** — Recent sales of similar homes below your assessed value
   - Harder to get in Texas (non-disclosure) but devastating when available
   - Recent purchase price below appraised = easy win (per January Advisors, ~20% of new homeowners protest)

3. **Property Condition Evidence** — Photos, contractor estimates, insurance claims
   - Foundation issues, roof damage, flood damage, deferred maintenance
   - Contractor repair estimates carry significant weight
   - This adds to ANY protest argument

4. **Property Record Error Corrections** — Wrong square footage, room count, features
   - Correcting errors reduces value AND carries forward to future years
   - O'Connor: "Correcting an error in the appraisal district's description of your property can reap savings in future years"

5. **Dual Argument (Market Value + Equity)** — File both
   - Texas A&M Real Estate Research Center explicitly recommends checking "and/or" on Form 50-132
   - ARB must grant the LOWER of the two values
   - Always file both — no downside

### What Gets Results:

| Factor | Impact | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Strong equity comps (3-5) | HIGH | Most effective in TX non-disclosure |
| Recent purchase price < appraised | VERY HIGH | Easy win for new buyers |
| Property condition documentation | MEDIUM-HIGH | Photos + contractor estimates |
| Record error corrections | HIGH | Permanent benefit |
| Presenting in person vs online | MARGINAL | Data shows online DIY is effective |
| Hiring an agent | NEGATIVE to NEUTRAL | DIY outperforms in Harris County |
| Attending ARB vs informal | DEPENDS ON YEAR | Informal better in normal years |
| Filing early | SLIGHT POSITIVE | Better chance of Topline slot |

### What SquareDeal.tax Says Works:
- "Support your protest with solid comparable sales or equity comps, your chances of a reduction jump significantly"
- "Homeowners who present strong evidence informally or at the ARB can sometimes achieve better results [than Topline settlements]"
- "CADs often apply standardized discount formulas for Topline offers — regardless of your home's unique evidence"

---

## 10. Professional Firm Claims

### O'Connor & Associates
- **Claims: "~65% of those who appeal win"** (on their website/blog)
- **Claims: "80-90% of informal settlements result in a reduction"**
- Reports: "1.8 million successful appeals filed" (cumulative)
- **"No flat fees. No upfront cost. No cost ever unless we reduce your taxes"**
- Contingency model — meaning "success" = any reduction, even $1
- **Reality check:** HCAD data shows agent success rates are LOWER than DIY (SquareDeal.tax analysis)

### Ownwell
- **Claims: "86% success rate"** (stated on website, Business Insider, Valon partnership, WorkMoney)
- **Claims: "$774 average annual savings"** (current website)
- **Also claims: "$1,147 average savings"** (Business Insider review)
- **Also claims: "88% success rate in Texas specifically"**
- **Fee: 25% of actual tax savings**, $0 upfront
- Has published 3-year impact study with real county-level data (very credible)
- **⚠️ "86% success rate" = customers who signed up and got ANY reduction**
- Does not specify how large the reduction needs to be

### Home Tax Shield
- **Claims: "83% success rate"**
- **Claims: "fees 40% lower than many competitors"**
- Houston-focused

### NTPTS (North Texas Property Tax Services)
- **Claims: "$100+ million in residential reductions" in each of last 6 years**
- **93% client retention rate**
- No explicit win rate published
- Founded 2003, North Texas focused

### Gill, Denson & Company
- **Claims: "83% success rate"** (per resimpli.com article)

### Kensington Research (Cook County)
- **Claims: "90% success rate" at Board of Review** (vs 62% overall BOR rate)
- **Claims: "$1,000-$5,000/year reductions" for typical clients**
- "30% higher than homeowners submitting their own appeal electronically"

### Chandler Crouch (Free Tax Protest / Tarrant County)
- **90,000+ homeowners helped for free**
- Provides free protest filing and evidence
- Does not charge; funded by real estate business referrals
- **"Should I protest? YES, always protest"** — his consistent message

### How "Success" is Measured — THE CAVEAT:
- **Almost all firms define "success" as ANY reduction** — even $1
- None publish what % get 5%+, 10%+, or 20%+ reductions
- Contingency-based firms are incentivized to count any reduction as a "win"
- **The median reduction matters more than the win rate**
- A firm with "90% success" getting median $3K reductions is worse than DIY with 71% success getting median $20K reductions

---

## 11. Year-Over-Year Trends

### Texas Protests Are INCREASING
- **2014: 1.2 million protests → 2023: 3.1 million protests** (160% increase)
- **% of parcels protested: 6.5% (2014) → 13.6% (2023)**
- Slight decline in 2024 to 3.0M (12.9%) — likely due to market cooling + Prop 4

### Success Rates Are SHIFTING
- **Pre-2023 (Harris County): 53-84% overall success rate**
- **Post-2023 (Harris County): 25-29% overall success rate**
- This is a **structural break**, not a blip
- Likely driven by: market correction, tighter CAD offers, more protest volume

### Prop 4 Impact ($100K Homestead Exemption, Nov 2023)
- Increased school district homestead exemption from $40K to $100K
- Average homeowner savings: ~$1,200/year (Texas Legislature estimate)
- Seniors/disabled: up to ~$1,400/year
- **Did NOT reduce protest volumes** — 2024 still had 3M+ protests
- BUT may have reduced the *urgency* of protesting for lower-value homes
- 2025 proposal: increase to $140,000 (SB 4, passed Senate unanimously Feb 2025)

### COVID vs Current
- 2020-2021: High success rates (83-84% in Harris County)
- 2022: Success rates started declining (74%)
- 2023-2024: Sharp drop to 25-29%
- **COVID-era was the golden age for protests** — valuations were uncertain, CADs were more lenient
- Current: CADs have better data, tighter tolerance bands, more sophisticated models

### Agent Volume Explosion
- 2023: DIY made up 75% of Harris County protests
- 2025: **Agents made up 80% of protests** (complete reversal!)
- Agent-led protests surged to 312,358 in 2025 (up from 81,450 in 2023)
- **Agent success rate crashed to 16%** as volume overwhelmed quality
- DIY success rate rebounded to 71% as casual filers exited

## 12. What We Can Promise Customers

### What We CAN Say (with data backing):

✅ **"Most property owners who protest their taxes get a reduction"**
- True historically (60-84% success rates pre-2023)
- Need to caveat with recent trends

✅ **"Property owners who protest save hundreds to thousands of dollars per year"**
- Average savings range: $641 - $1,147 depending on source and year
- Median reductions: $14K-$22K in assessed value

✅ **"DIY homeowners with good evidence often outperform professional firms"**
- Well-documented across 9 years of Harris County data
- Also true in Cook County (CCAO and BOR data)

✅ **"Protesting every year compounds your savings"**
- Ownwell study shows non-protesters accumulate 11% higher market values over 3 years
- CADs use prior year values as starting point

✅ **"There's zero risk to protesting — your value can never go UP from a protest"**
- Texas Tax Code protects protesters at both informal and formal hearings

✅ **"About [X]% of properties in your county are protested each year"**
- Use county-specific data (see tables above)

### What We SHOULD NOT Say:

❌ **"85% of protests result in a reduction"** — Not universally true anymore (Harris County 2024: 25%)
❌ **"Average savings of $1,000+"** — Depends heavily on property value, county, and year
❌ **"Guaranteed savings"** — Can never guarantee outcomes
❌ **"We'll save you money"** — Must be conditional

### Recommended Marketing Language:

> **"Historically, 60-85% of Texas property tax protests result in a reduction. The median reduction for successful protests in Harris County is $15,000-$22,000 in assessed value, which translates to $400-$600+ in annual tax savings. Results vary by county, year, and the strength of your evidence."**

> **"Homeowners who prepare strong, evidence-based protests — with comparable equity data, property condition documentation, and record corrections — consistently achieve better outcomes than those who wing it or use volume-based agents."**

> **"Our data shows that well-prepared DIY homeowners achieve higher median reductions than professional protest companies in most years."**

### Disclaimer Language (Recommended):

> *"Past results do not guarantee future performance. Success rates and reduction amounts vary by county, property type, market conditions, and the quality of evidence presented. Statistics cited are based on publicly available data from [source] for [time period]. Individual results may differ. [Overtaxed/Company Name] is not affiliated with any appraisal district or government entity."*

## Implications for Overtaxed

### Our Value Proposition (supported by data):

1. **Evidence quality > representation** — The data overwhelmingly shows that WHAT you bring matters more than WHO brings it. Our AI-powered evidence generation puts DIY homeowners on par with (or above) professional firms.

2. **The agent model is broken** — Agents filing volume protests with formula reductions get LOWER success rates AND lower median reductions than prepared DIY homeowners. Our model should expose this.

3. **The opportunity is massive** — 70-82% of homeowners DON'T protest. In Bexar County, 81.6% of homes weren't protested in 2024. Every non-protester is a potential customer.

4. **Annual protesting matters** — Ownwell's study proves a compounding effect: non-protesters accumulate 11% higher market values over 3 years. We should emphasize the annual subscription value.

5. **Cook County is a strong market** — 62% BOR success rate, but attorney vs DIY shows no difference at CCAO level. Our evidence-based approach can serve this market well.

6. **We have a transparency edge** — Most firms cherry-pick stats. We can show customers REAL data and let them see how our evidence compares. SquareDeal.tax proves this approach builds trust.

### Marketing Differentiators:
- "We give you the evidence. The data shows that's what actually wins."
- "Professional firms get 16-27% success rates in Harris County. Prepared DIY homeowners get 71%+."
- "The average Texan who protests saves $600-$1,100/year. Those who don't protest leave that money on the table."
- "Zero risk: your value can never increase from a protest."
