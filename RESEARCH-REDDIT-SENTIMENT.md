## Top Fears & Objections (Why People DON'T Protest)

1. **"Will it hurt me when I sell?"** — Common misconception that protesting "locks in" a lower value that affects resale. People genuinely fear the county will use their protested value against them.
2. **"It's a waste of time for small savings"** — Many feel that even a $20K reduction in appraised value only saves a few hundred dollars. Not worth the hassle.
3. **"I don't know how / the process is confusing"** — First-time homeowners are overwhelmed by forms (50-132), deadlines (May 15), where to find comps, what evidence counts.
4. **"I tried DIY and got laughed at"** — Multiple accounts of people bringing comps to hearings only to have the appraiser pull up Zillow, note remodels, and dismiss their evidence. Humiliating experience.
5. **"The system feels like a racket"** — Hearing panels staffed by people "without jobs getting paid $250/day," protest companies that used to work at the CAD. People feel the deck is stacked.
6. **"My homestead cap already limits the increase to 10%"** — Many believe if they're capped at 10%, there's nothing to protest. They don't understand market value vs. assessed value distinction.
7. **"I just bought — my value should be right"** — New homeowners assume purchase price = fair value and don't realize the CAD may appraise higher.
8. **"Fear of retaliation / increased scrutiny"** — Some worry protesting puts a target on their back for future years.
9. **"Missing the deadline"** — May 15 sneaks up on people. Many discover the process too late.

## Top Motivations (Why People DO Protest)

1. **Massive appraisal increases** — 20-50%+ jumps in a single year are common triggers. "50% increase in property taxes" posts get huge engagement.
2. **"Everyone should protest every year"** — Experienced homeowners say this universally. In Texas, the burden of proof for unequal appraisal lies with the CAD, not you.
3. **Significant savings are real** — Reports of $1,100/year savings (common), $167K valuation reductions, 19.7% reductions DIY. One person went from $321K to $301K appraised.
4. **No downside** — Universally confirmed: your taxes cannot go UP from protesting. Worst case is no change.
5. **"Texas is a non-disclosure state"** — The CAD doesn't automatically know your purchase price. This is a strategic advantage.
6. **Neighbors paying less** — Finding comparable homes assessed lower per square foot is a powerful motivator.
7. **New homeowners can use closing price** — If appraised above purchase price, submitting your closing statement almost guarantees a match.
8. **Anger at the system** — "Texas: where we tax unrealized capital gains" — deep resentment fuels action.

## DIY vs. Agent Sentiment

### DIY Advocates Say:
- "Self protest here — got 19.7% reduction"
- Use HCAD/DCAD/TCAD websites to pull neighborhood data, sort by $/sqft, find lower-assessed comparable homes
- Free tools exist: someone built a free website to generate Harris County protest reports that works as well as Ownwell's data
- For new homeowners, just submit closing statement — you don't need anyone
- Form 50-132 is straightforward if you know about it

### DIY Frustrations:
- "I had detailed comps. They laughed in my face and said my house was newer"
- "They had my Zillow pulled up and knew my house was remodeled"
- "Navigating the county system sucks. They aren't very forthcoming with what they want to see"
- Getting MLS data is hard without a realtor
- Scheduling hearings is increasingly difficult with volume of protesters
- The informal hearing feels adversarial and intimidating

### Pro-Agent Advocates Say:
- "Protested myself the first year. Have been using [service] every year since and it takes no effort"
- "We protested them ourselves for years but with the amount of protesters now, difficulty in scheduling, and getting comps they'll agree with, this is just so much easier"
- Companies have relationships with the CAD and know what evidence works
- "My time is more valuable" — $50-$75 flat fee services exist
- Contingency fee models (pay only if they save you) eliminate risk

### Pro-Agent Frustrations:
- Some agents don't show up to hearings (Chandler Crouch complaint — submitted lazy mass appraisal evidence)
- 5Stone charges flat fee even if no savings; wouldn't share their evidence documents
- Fee structures keep changing and getting worse
- Some feel agents could have gotten more but settle quickly
- Referral spam on Reddit (especially Ownwell) makes recommendations suspect

## Companies Mentioned & Sentiment

| Company | Sentiment | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Ownwell** | Generally positive | 25% of tax savings, good UI, "no cure no fee." Heavy referral spam on Reddit raises skepticism. Multiple users report good results. |
| **Five Stone Tax Advisors** | Mixed-positive | Austin-focused. "Got my appraisal down significantly." Complaints about fee structure changes. |
| **Texas Pro Tax** | Positive | "Brought it down significantly the following year" after DIY failed. |
| **O'Connor & Associates** | Mixed | Large/established. Some feel they're too big, mass-process approach. |
| **Bettencourt Tax Advisors** | Mixed | "The guy is an assclown but his company does good work." $75 setup + 10% of savings. |
| **Texas Tax Protestors** | Positive | $50 flat fee. "Totally worth it." |
| **Mefferd & Associates** | Positive | Houston. "They've never failed me." |
| **Urban Tax Protestors** | Positive | Houston. Contingency model. |
| **Ray Tax** | Positive | Austin. "Takes no effort." |
| **Chandler Crouch** | Negative | Fort Worth. Didn't show up to hearing, lazy evidence packets with self-promotional cover photos. |
| **North Texas Property Tax Services** | Neutral | Charges 40% of reduced appraisal value — seen as expensive. |

## Common Advice & Tips Shared

1. **Always protest. Every single year.** No exceptions.
2. **New homeowners: submit your closing statement** — CAD will likely match purchase price since Texas is non-disclosure.
3. **File your homestead exemption FIRST** — many people forget this step entirely.
4. **Use "unequal appraisal" as your basis** — burden of proof shifts to CAD.
5. **Find comps by neighborhood:** Search your neighborhood on the CAD site, sort by $/sqft, find homes assessed lower.
6. **Document defects:** Foundation cracks, old roof, damaged insulation, dead trees, busy street, sloping lot — all legitimate evidence.
7. **Include repair estimates** for any issues — substantiates your claims.
8. **Don't ask for too much** — requesting ~5% reduction is more likely to settle at informal stage. Ask for too much and they refer you to formal hearing.
9. **Use iSettle/iFile (Harris County)** — online settlement tools to avoid in-person hearings entirely.
10. **Understand market value vs. assessed value** — the 10% homestead cap applies to assessed, but you still benefit from lowering market value for future years.
11. **Deadline is May 15** (postmark date) — don't wait.
12. **Protest online when possible** — in-person formal hearings are widely described as "waste of time."

## Paraphrased Quotes We Could Use

> "I've protested every single year. No downsides but a bit of your time and the frustration of dealing with it."

> "The system is designed to be confusing — just like how TurboTax lobbies to keep tax filing complicated so their business thrives."

> "I tried to protest myself. Had a realtor pull comps. They laughed at me — they had my Zillow pulled up and knew my house was remodeled."

> "Everyone should protest. In Texas, the burden of proof lies with the CAD, not you."

> "We protested ourselves for years, but with the volume of protesters now and difficulty getting comps they'll accept, using a service is just so much easier."

> "Texas: where we tax unrealized capital gains."

> "I used a free tool and got my value from $321K to $301K. Then I got a letter from Ownwell saying they could get exactly the same number. Seems like they pull data from the same source."

> "My property taxes went up 50% in a single year. I need help — I can't pay."

> "I protested my taxes and the new appraisal came back HIGHER." (fear-confirming but turned out to be a misunderstanding of the process)

## What People Wish Existed (Unmet Needs = Our Opportunity)

### 1. **"Tell me if it's even worth protesting"**
People want a simple yes/no answer BEFORE they invest time. Ownwell has a basic tool for this but users say it's "not extremely accurate."

### 2. **"Show me exactly what evidence to use"**
The #1 pain point. People don't know how to find comps, what the CAD will accept, or how to present it. They want someone to say "here are your 5 best comparable properties and why."

### 3. **"Help me understand the difference between market value, appraised value, and assessed value"**
Massive confusion. People don't know what they're even protesting or how the 10% homestead cap interacts with market value protests.

### 4. **"Free or cheap comp data without needing a realtor"**
MLS data is locked behind agents. Someone built a free Harris County tool and it went viral — huge demand for accessible comp data.

### 5. **"Don't make me go to a hearing"**
People dread in-person hearings. Online settlement (iSettle) is beloved where available. Anything that eliminates the adversarial human interaction wins.

### 6. **"Transparency from protest companies"**
Users complained that companies wouldn't share what evidence they submitted. People want to see the work and learn from it.

### 7. **"Automatic annual protesting"**
Multiple people describe forgetting, missing deadlines, or the annual hassle of re-signing up. They want a "set it and forget it" solution.

### 8. **"Someone who actually shows up and fights"**
Bad experiences with agents who mass-process and don't show up to hearings. People want to feel like someone is actually advocating for THEIR property.

### 9. **"Explain it to me like I'm five"**
First-time homeowners are completely lost. They post "total noob" questions. They want a step-by-step guide that's actually simple, not a government PDF.

### 10. **"Fair pricing"**
Resentment at 25-40% of savings. People do the math and realize they're paying $275-$440 for what might be a simple form submission. Flat fee ($50-$75) services get better sentiment.

## Key Takeaways for Product Strategy

- **The protest itself is NOT the hard part** — finding and presenting the right evidence is. A tool that automates evidence gathering wins.
- **Education is a massive gap** — most people don't understand basic concepts (market vs. assessed value, homestead cap implications, non-disclosure state advantage).
- **Trust is low** — referral spam from Ownwell has created skepticism. Transparent, non-spammy positioning would differentiate.
- **New homeowners are the most confused AND most likely to save** — they're the ideal target audience.
- **Flat fee beats percentage** in sentiment — people feel percentage-based pricing is unfair for simple cases.
- **The annual cycle creates natural urgency** — April-May is when everyone panics and searches Reddit.
- **Community-built free tools go viral** — the free Harris County report generator was shared enthusiastically. Open/free tools build trust and audience.
