# Round 3 — Content & Legal Quality Panel Review

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Panel:** Mark Richardson (TX tax consultant), Diana Kowalski (IL tax attorney), Sarah Nguyen (former HCAD appraiser), James Whitfield (consumer rights attorney)  
**Materials Reviewed:** Cook County PDF template, Houston PDF template, both email templates

---

## Panel Process

Each panelist reviewed both PDF templates and email templates independently, then two rounds of debate produced this unified report.

## STRENGTHS — What to Keep

### Overall Design & Approach
- **The $/sqft uniformity argument is correctly chosen for both jurisdictions.** This is the single strongest strategy for residential properties. Professional firms use this exact approach. (Mark, Sarah, Diana — unanimous)
- **The visual design is excellent.** Summary cards with red/green color coding immediately communicate the problem and solution. ARB panelists and BOR commissioners see hundreds of cases — this visual hierarchy helps them absorb the argument in seconds. (Sarah: "When I was at HCAD, the cases that got settled fastest were the ones where I could see the disparity at a glance. These summary cards do that.")
- **Subject property highlighted in the comps table (red ★ row).** This is exactly how professional firms present it. The subject stands out immediately against the green-highlighted comp $/sqft values. (Mark: "This is how O'Connor, Ownwell, and every serious firm does it. Nailed.")
- **Copy-paste notes for Cook County.** Brilliant. The BOR form's "Notes" field is where most homeowners freeze. Having pre-written text eliminates that barrier completely. (Diana: "This alone is worth $49. My clients pay $200/hr for me to write this.")
- **ARB hearing script for Houston.** Word-for-word scripts reduce anxiety dramatically. The script correctly structures the argument: identify property → state current value → present comps → cite §42.26 → state requested value. (Mark: "This is the exact structure I use. Perfect.")
- **iSettle guidance in Houston template.** Smart inclusion — many first-timers don't know about iSettle or how to evaluate the offer. The "accept if at or below fair value, reject if above" guidance is exactly right. (Sarah: "About 60% of HCAD protests settle through iSettle. This guidance prevents people from leaving money on the table.")
- **Assessment history table (Cook County).** Shows the trend and demonstrates the pattern of over-assessment. BOR commissioners look at this. (Diana)
- **Homestead exemption reminder (Houston).** Many Texas homeowners don't have this filed. Good catch. (Mark)
- **The 10% homestead cap explanation (Houston).** Most homeowners don't understand why protesting still matters with the cap. This explanation is correct and persuasive. (Mark: "The number of clients I've had who think the cap means they don't need to protest — this is important.")
- **"No attorney required" messaging.** Empowering and legally accurate for individual homeowners in both jurisdictions. (James)
- **LLC/trust attorney requirement note (Cook County).** Critical legal disclaimer that protects Overtaxed from liability. (Diana: "If an LLC-owned property tries to file without an attorney and gets rejected, that's on them, but this warning covers you.")

### Comp Selection Logic
- **Same-neighborhood, same-class filtering with $/sqft-below-subject threshold** is the correct approach. This ensures every comp supports the argument — no comp undermines the case. (Mark, Sarah — both confirmed this is industry standard)
- **Sorting by $/sqft ascending (lowest first)** presents the strongest evidence first. Smart. (Sarah)

## CRITICAL GAPS — Must Fix

### P0 — Fix Before Selling More

#### 1. Cook County: Missing Deadline Urgency / Timeline Info
**The Cook County PDF has no deadline warning box.** Houston has a prominent yellow warning box about deadlines. Cook County's instructions just say "check if your township is open" — but there's no urgency, no typical timeline, no "you usually have 30 days" guidance.

**Why it matters:** Cook County townships open on a rolling schedule and each is only open for ~30 days. If someone buys this package and their township isn't open yet, they need to know WHEN to act. If it's already open, they need to know they might only have days left.

**Fix:** Add a yellow warning box identical to Houston's, something like:
> "⏰ **Deadline:** The Board of Review opens each township for approximately 30 days. Your township ({township}) must be open to file. Check cookcountyboardofreview.com for your township's dates. Once your township opens, file immediately — you cannot file after it closes."

*Diana: "I've seen people buy appeal packages from competitors and miss the window because nobody told them the deadline. This is a P0."*

#### 2. Houston: Incorrect §42.26 Citation in the Brief
The brief cites **"Section 42.26(a)(3)"** — this subsection specifically describes the remedy (how the ARB calculates the new value), not the right to protest on uniformity grounds. The right to protest is established under **§41.41(a)(2)** and the standard for unequal appraisal is in **§42.26(a)(1)-(2)**.

**Why it matters:** An HCAD appraiser who knows the code (many do) will notice this. It doesn't invalidate the argument, but it undermines credibility. A professional firm would not make this error.

**Fix:** Rephrase to: "Under Texas Tax Code §41.41(a)(2), the property owner has the right to protest on grounds of unequal appraisal. Section 42.26(a) provides that the appraised value of property shall not exceed the median appraised value of a reasonable number of comparable properties appropriately adjusted."

*Mark: "This won't kill the case — the ARB knows what you mean — but it's sloppy. Professional firms cite §41.41 for the protest right and §42.26 for the remedy. Fix this."*

*Sarah: "As an appraiser, I'd notice this and it would make me take the packet less seriously. Small thing, big impact."*

#### 3. Cook County: The Brief Doesn't Cite the Right Legal Authority Correctly
The brief references "Article IX, Section 4 of the Illinois Constitution" — this is correct for the uniformity clause, but the brief should ALSO cite the **Property Tax Code (35 ILCS 200/16-70 through 16-95)** which governs Board of Review appeals specifically, and **16-185** which establishes the standard of proof.

**Why it matters:** BOR commissioners are quasi-judicial officers. They respond to specific statutory citations, not just constitutional principles. The constitutional cite is the foundation, but the statutory cite shows you know the actual procedure.

**Fix:** Add to the brief: "Pursuant to 35 ILCS 200/16-70 et seq., the Board of Review has authority to revise and correct assessments to achieve uniformity. The evidence presented demonstrates that the subject property's assessment departs from the level of assessment of comparable properties, warranting a reduction under Article IX, Section 4 of the Illinois Constitution."

*Diana: "The constitutional cite alone is fine for amateurs, but adding the PTCA cite makes this look like it was prepared by a professional. Huge credibility boost for $0 additional effort."*

#### 4. No Comp Validation / Quality Disclaimer
Neither template addresses what happens when comps are weak — e.g., when comp properties have significantly different ages, conditions, or features. There's also no disclaimer about comp quality.

**Why it matters:** If a homeowner's comps include a 1950s home compared to their 2010 build, the appraiser will dismiss the entire packet. The homeowner won't know why they lost.

**Fix:** Add a brief note: "These comparable properties were selected based on proximity, neighborhood, size, and property classification. If the appraiser challenges a specific comparable, focus on the ones most similar to your property in age and size. Even 3-4 strong comps are sufficient to demonstrate unequal treatment."

*Sarah: "At HCAD I would regularly throw out 3-4 comps from a packet and the homeowner would panic. If they knew that even keeping 4-5 was enough, they'd be more confident."*

### P1 — Important

#### 5. Houston: No Assessment History
Cook County includes a 5-year assessment history table. Houston has nothing. This is a meaningful omission.

**Why it matters:** Assessment history shows the trend. If the value jumped 25% in one year, that's additional ammunition. HCAD appraisers look at the trajectory.

**Fix:** Add assessment history if available from HCAD data. Even just 2-3 years of appraised values would help. If the data isn't easily available, at minimum add a note: "Check your appraisal notice for your property's value history. If your value increased significantly this year, mention that during your hearing."

*Mark: "The 10% cap makes this less critical for homestead properties, but for non-homestead or newly purchased properties, the history is crucial. I'd call this P1 because the $/sqft argument is strong enough alone."*

#### 6. Cook County: Missing "Request a Hearing? → No" Explanation
Step 4 says to select "No" for requesting a hearing, with a brief note that "written evidence is stronger." This is dangerous advice without more context.

**Why it matters:** For standard uniformity appeals, written-only is fine and actually preferred (commissioners review the written evidence). But if the property has unique characteristics, damage, or other issues, a hearing IS warranted. More importantly, the homeowner needs to understand WHY written is preferred — otherwise they feel like they're giving up a right.

**Fix:** Expand to: "Select 'No' for a hearing. In most uniformity appeals, the written evidence (your comps and brief) is reviewed by commissioners and is sufficient. Hearings are typically only useful if your property has physical damage, unique features not reflected in records, or other issues that can't be shown in a document. By filing written-only, your case is typically reviewed faster."

*Diana: "I advise most of my individual clients to skip the hearing too. But I explain why. The current wording feels like 'just trust us' — give them the reason."*

#### 7. Neither Template Has a "What Happens Next" Timeline
Both templates explain how to file but not what to expect after filing. Homeowners want to know: When will I hear back? How long does this take? What does a decision look like?

**Cook County fix:** "After filing, the Board of Review will review your appeal. Decisions are typically issued within 60-90 days after your township's filing period closes. You'll receive a notice by mail with the Board's decision. If the Board reduces your assessment, the reduction will be reflected in your next tax bill (usually the second installment)."

**Houston fix:** The step 5 ("After the Hearing") touches on this but is vague. Add: "ARB decisions are typically issued at the hearing or mailed within 2-3 weeks. If your value is reduced, it takes effect for the current tax year and will be reflected in your tax bill (usually mailed in October)."

*James: "Uncertainty is the #1 reason people abandon processes. Telling them 'you'll hear back in 60-90 days' eliminates the 'did it even work?' anxiety."*

#### 8. Houston Email: Missing Deadline in Subject Line or Preview Text
The Houston email subject line is: "Property Tax Protest Package — {address} — Harris County"

**Fix:** Add urgency: "Property Tax Protest Package — {address} — File by May 15" or "ACTION REQUIRED: Your Property Tax Protest Package — {address}"

The email body has the deadline warning, but email open rates are driven by subject lines. If the subject conveys urgency, open rates go up.

*James: "People get a lot of email. If it says 'ACTION REQUIRED' or has a deadline, it gets opened. If it's a generic 'here's your package,' it sits in the inbox."*

#### 9. Cook County: No Photo Example or Guidance Quality
The photo reminder (Rule #17) tells people to take a photo but gives no guidance on what makes a GOOD photo vs. one that could hurt their case.

**Fix:** Add: "Tips for your photo: Stand across the street for a full-frame shot. Do NOT include any renovations, additions, or improvements that might increase your assessed value. If your property shows wear or age, that works in your favor — the photo should look honest and unenhanced."

*Diana: "I've had clients submit photos of their newly renovated kitchen and wonder why their assessment went UP. A front-of-building photo showing wear and age supports the argument."*

*Sarah: "HCAD doesn't require photos for §42.26, but Cook County does. The photo advice is important for Cook County — a bad photo can literally hurt the case."*

#### 10. Cook County: "BOR Appraisal" Document Type May Be Wrong
Step 6 says to select **"BOR Appraisal"** from the document type dropdown. This should be verified — the Board of Review's system categories change periodically. If this is wrong, the homeowner gets stuck.

**Fix:** Verify the current dropdown options. If uncertain, say: "Select the document type that best matches — typically 'BOR Appraisal' or 'Comparable Properties' or 'Supporting Evidence.' The exact label may vary."

*Diana: "I file these regularly and the dropdown options change. 'BOR Appraisal' was valid last year but I'd hedge this."*

### P2 — Nice to Have

#### 11. Neither Template Includes a Visual Chart
A bar chart or scatter plot showing the subject property's $/sqft vs. comps would be dramatically more persuasive than a table alone. Professional firms (O'Connor, PTAG, Ryan) always include a visual comparison.

**Fix:** Add a simple bar chart showing subject $/sqft (red bar) vs. each comp (green bars) with the median line. This could be generated as an SVG inline in the HTML.

*Mark: "O'Connor's packets always have a chart. It's the first thing the appraiser looks at. Tables are evidence; charts are persuasion."*

*Sarah: "I'll second this. As an appraiser flipping through 40 cases, a chart that shows a red bar towering over green bars is immediate. The table requires me to read. The chart requires me to glance."*

#### 12. Houston: No Mention of Evidence Submission Timing
The Houston instructions say to upload "this PDF" when filing via iFile. But many homeowners don't realize they can (and should) also submit evidence AFTER filing but before their hearing. HCAD's system allows evidence uploads up to 14 days before the hearing.

**Fix:** Add a note: "You can upload additional evidence (photos, repair estimates, recent sales data) through your iFile account up until 14 days before your scheduled hearing. If you find better comparable data or have evidence of needed repairs, submit it."

*Mark: "This is standard advice I give every client. The initial filing is just opening the door. You can keep adding evidence."*

#### 13. Cook County: No Mention of Assessor-Level Appeal
The "Important Information" section mentions the "two-bite strategy" (Assessor + BOR), but the instructions only cover the BOR filing. Professional firms file at both levels.

**Fix:** Add a brief section or expand the important info: "If your township hasn't been assessed yet this cycle, you can ALSO appeal with the Assessor's Office when they open for review. This gives you two chances — first with the Assessor, then with the Board of Review. Most professional firms file at both levels."

*Diana: "The two-bite is mentioned but not explained. This could be a separate small section with a link to the Assessor's appeal portal."*

#### 14. Comp Distance / Proximity Information
Neither template shows how close the comps are to the subject property. Distance is one of the first things an appraiser checks.

**Fix:** If geocoding data is available, add a "Distance" column or note showing comps are within the same neighborhood. Even a simple statement like "All comparables are within Assessment Neighborhood {X}, which encompasses approximately [area description]" adds credibility.

*Sarah: "When a homeowner presents comps from across town, I dismiss them immediately. When they say 'all within 0.5 miles in the same neighborhood,' I take it seriously."*

#### 15. Houston: No Mention of Agent Authorization Form
If a homeowner wants someone else (spouse, family member, friend) to attend the ARB hearing on their behalf, they need a signed authorization. The template doesn't mention this.

**Fix:** Add a brief note: "If someone else will attend the hearing on your behalf, HCAD requires a signed Agent Authorization form. You can download this from hcad.org."

#### 16. Email: No Clear Next-Step CTA After the Package Link
Both emails end with a "View Appeal Package" button and then just a footer. There's no "Here's what to do first" call-to-action.

**Fix:** After the button, add:
> "**Your next step:** Open the PDF, skip to the 'How to File' section, and follow the step-by-step instructions. Total time: about 15 minutes."

*James: "The moment someone opens this email, they need to know: what do I do RIGHT NOW? The button is great, but 'open the PDF and go to page X' reduces the activation energy."*

#### 17. Neither Template Mentions What a Successful Outcome Looks Like
Homeowners don't know what to expect from a reduction. Will they get a check? Does the tax bill change? When?

**Fix:** Add a brief "What Happens If You Win" section:
- **Cook County:** "If the Board of Review reduces your assessment, you'll receive a revised notice. The reduction is typically reflected in your second-installment tax bill. You don't need to do anything — the county adjusts your bill automatically."
- **Houston:** "If your appraised value is reduced, HCAD updates your account. The lower value will be reflected in your tax bill (mailed around October). If you've already paid, you may be eligible for a refund of the overpayment."

## THE $49 QUESTION

### Current Value Assessment

**Mark (Texas):** "For Houston, this is legitimately competitive with what $150-300 firms deliver. The hearing script alone is something most DIY guides don't include. The comps are solid because they're filtered to same-neighborhood and lower-$/sqft. At $49, this is a good deal. Fix the §42.26 cite and add a chart, and it's an incredible deal."

**Diana (Illinois):** "For Cook County, the copy-paste notes and step-by-step instructions are the killer features. My clients pay me $400+ per appeal and I'm essentially doing what this PDF does — picking comps, writing a brief, and filing. The $49 price is almost too low. Add the statutory citation and deadline warning, and this competes with any $200 filing service."

**Sarah (HCAD perspective):** "From an appraiser's desk, these packets would get taken seriously. They're better formatted than most attorney submissions I've seen. The $/sqft argument with same-neighborhood comps filtered below the subject — that's exactly the evidence that makes me settle rather than fight. Worth $49? Easily."

**James (Consumer perspective):** "A first-time filer could follow these instructions and succeed. That's the bar. The Cook County template clears it; the Houston template clears it with room to spare (the hearing script is a huge confidence booster). Worth $49? Yes, if the homeowner saves even $200/year, the ROI is obvious. The packaging sells itself. But the email needs to drive them to ACT — add urgency and a clear first step."

### What Would Make It Feel Like an Absolute Steal

1. **The bar chart.** Visual proof is the single highest-ROI addition. It takes the packet from "good evidence" to "undeniable evidence." (Unanimous)
2. **A one-page summary sheet** that could be printed as a standalone "cheat sheet" for the hearing — just the subject, median, top 5 comps, and requested value on one page. People want something they can hold in their hand during a hearing or phone call. (Mark, James)
3. **Success statistics.** If Overtaxed tracks outcomes, adding "73% of our customers get a reduction" (or whatever the real number is) would be incredibly powerful in both the email and the PDF. (James)
4. **A "What to say if they push back" FAQ.** The Houston hearing script covers the opening statement, but what if the appraiser says "your comps are in a different condition" or "those are smaller homes"? 3-4 common objections with responses would turn this from a script into a coaching session. (Mark, Sarah)
5. **Year-over-year tracking.** "Buy once, and we'll email you next year when your new assessment is available." This turns a one-time $49 transaction into an ongoing relationship. (James: "This is how you get repeat customers without charging $49 every year — but you could.")

## PANEL CONSENSUS

This is a genuinely strong product. The legal arguments are correctly constructed (with the citation fixes noted above). The instructions are clear enough for a first-time filer. The formatting is professional. The comp selection methodology is sound.

The P0 fixes are all content/copy changes — no architectural work needed. Implementing just the P0s would take the product from "good" to "professional-grade." Adding the P1s would make it competitive with $200+ services. The P2s (especially the chart) would make it best-in-class for the price point.

**Bottom line:** After the P0 fixes, this is confidently worth $49 and arguably underpriced. The biggest risk isn't quality — it's that homeowners receive the package and procrastinate. The email and the first page of the PDF need to scream "DO THIS NOW" louder than they currently do.
